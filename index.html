		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/11/17/curriculum-vitae-repetitum.html">failing to become the next George Harrison</a>, I spent three years idling around, getting into trouble, and generally not knowing what to do with myself.</p>
<p>I had some summer jobs working on a local farm stacking straw bales on to lorries from Cockermouth, feeding turkeys, and working in the grain barn (doing what I can&rsquo;t remember, although I do remember not being able to breathe because of all the dust).</p>
<p>I remember one day my car broke down, leaving me and my baling partner stranded in a field in the middle of nowhere. It was a very second hand Mini Cooper, which ultimately failed its MoT when the <em>papier mâché</em> the previous careful owner had used to fill the side panel caught fire while the mechanic was welding something (it&rsquo;s a long time ago, and I never understood how cars work, partly thanks to my Physics teacher, who told all the boys to leave his class on &ldquo;how cars work&rdquo; because, obviously, being boys, we already knew).</p>
<p>Anyway, the farmer kindly gave us a lift home. On the way, he told us he would deduct the petrol money (£5 each) from our wages. Now in those days, £5 was quite a lot of money, certainly enough to get royally drunk on at the weekend and still have enough for a bag of chips from the Chinese takeaway afterwards.</p>
<p>I also worked some summers in the plastics factory my mum worked at. She, and the other local mums made children&rsquo;s play clothes, while the local children put poles into windbreaks to make sitting on the local beaches bearable in the face of the North Sea winds.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that there must be something wrong with me, and so I decided to go to University to study psychology and find a fix.</p>
<p>In order to get into Uni, I needed a better &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level result than me three Es from school, so I did a correspondence course in Law and got a B. I could have gone to Manchester Polytechnic, but instead elected to go to Bolton Institute of Higher Education. I was really too terrified to go to Manchester Poly (too big, too big city centre). Christ, I was even terrified of getting on the train (not knowing how or where to buy a ticket, how to know which train to get on, how to know when to get off, etc.).</p>
<p>Manchester appealed because it was where my dad hailed from (well, Oldham, really, although he went to school in Manchester, and, of course, went to Old Trafford to watch Best, Law and Charlton in their heyday).</p>
<p>Bolton was interesting and fun, though, and I made some good friends there, got a 2:1 degree, spent a year in the US on an exchange programme where I did several road trips across the country, climbed a mountain, nearly died in a blizzard, skied down other mountains, made no. 26 on the University Soccer Team, among other things.</p>
<p>In my first semester in the states, I was terribly homesick and made an unscheduled visit home for Christmas and New Year. When I went back, I got into the experience so much I wanted to stay, but couldn&rsquo;t get a job or visa to do so.</p>
<p>When I finished my degree, I was hopelessly lost again with know idea what to do. My degree had taught me (wrongly, imo) that psychological problems were contained wholly within the individual person and could be treated by taking lots of drugs (not that I was against that, at all). My careers advisor helpfully counselled that I could do anything I wanted to do as long as it wasn&rsquo;t psychology (for which I&rsquo;d need a medical degree). I half-heartedly applied to do a Masters degree, but the thought of more constrained studying wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted (I wanted money to buy drugs).</p>
<p>So, with friends, I got a summer job with an employment agency picking orders in an old cotton mill converted into a warehouse in Shaw. We supplemented the permanent staff, who could mostly be found sleeping in dens hidden inside a maze of boxes, and so had to work twice as hard for a fraction of the pay without any benefits of regular employment like sick pay, holidays, etc. Or in our case, as it turned out, no pay at all, at least until I led a delegation of workers to confront the hapless recruitment agent.</p>
<p>I quit that job, and looked around for work. I remember going to an interview in leafy Stockport (or maybe it was Wilmslow) or somewhere &ldquo;down south&rdquo; for some kind of &ldquo;trainee manager&rdquo; job. There were a lot them about at the time. While I was waiting to go in, I saw and heard all the staff gather for what appeared to be their regular morning meeting, where they began chanting some bizarre marketing cult bullshit. I made my excuses and ran for my life.</p>
<p>I signed up, instead, as a &ldquo;trainee manager&rdquo; for Domino&rsquo;s Pizza at their franchise in Swinton. I lasted six weeks, although it felt like longer. I worked 80 hour weeks for £80 a week and all the leftover pizza I could eat. My <em>nadir</em> was a Saturday night when I found myself left alone in charge of the shop and unable to cope. I was never the fastest at making the fast food. In those days, Domino&rsquo;s promised to deliver within 40 minutes of your order or you get it for free. Once I got behind, it was impossible to catch up. On this night I swear people were phoning their friends saying, &ldquo;Free pizza at Domino&rsquo;s! It&rsquo;ll be stone cold when you get it, but hey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dad threatened to get me job in the pea processing plant where he was now a supervisor back in Grimsby, and while I ended up moving back with him I worked in a high street burger bar called <em>Yankees</em> (I called it <em>Wankers</em>) instead. Why? I don&rsquo;t know, because I was clearly unsuited to the frenetic, frantic pace of the work, and dealing with drunken customers in the early hours of a Saturday or Sunday morning. I remember chasing a group of youths down the street with a carving knife after they squirted ketchup all over my nice clean shop walls.</p>
<p>Along with my best friend at Uni, I applied for a job at Manchester University as a Research Assistant. I was terrible at interviews then, while he breezed it. I was absolutely gutted, and couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Then, out of the blue a few weeks later, my mate called me to tell me they had a job for me. So back I went. I spent three years researching nothing at all, but thoroughly enjoying living the life in Manchester city centre, with all that entailed, in the early 90s.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s my 365 day &lsquo;anniversary&rsquo; on micro.blog.</p>
<p>When I moved here last year, it was in the wake of the X-ification of Twitter, the exodus to Mastodon, and generally wanting to start blogging/writing again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on Twitter/X, and left Mastodon to move. I did start blogging a bit more to begin with, but that soon tailed off to nothing, as it always does.</p>
<p>I did try to interact with the micro.blog community, and I follow quite a few people here and find their posts interesting enough to <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/bookmarked/">bookmark</a> on a regular basis.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t really looking for community, or even interaction particularly. More a place to keep in touch with a few old identi.ca/Mastodon friends, and have my own place on the web.</p>
<p>My recent new <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/09/29/human-shield.html">volunteering role</a> has meant I have a regular time and space to write, and I realise now that what&rsquo;s important (as everyone who writes always says), is simply to write (and publish). Nothing&rsquo;s ever finished or perfect, and it doesn&rsquo;t need to be. Very few (external) links or photos, or anything that isn&rsquo;t writing.</p>
<p>And I like it.</p>

			 <p>ToryBoy The Movie is the account of filmmaker John Walsh&rsquo;s disillusionment with what he saw as the corruption, lies, hypocrisy and general incompetence of Blair&rsquo;s Labour government, and his conversion to the Conservative (Tory) Party general election candidate for Middlesbrough in 2010.</p>
<p>Under his own steam and £15,000 of his own money, John found his opponent, Sir Stuart Bell, the serial incumbent Labour MP, invisible and unknown to his local constituents who nevertheless voted him back in every four or five years (albeit with an ever diminishing majority). Bell was too busy, it seemed, living in Paris, and employing his family not to answer phone calls at his parliamentary office. Worse, his son stole £8,000 worth of stuff from Bell&rsquo;s parliamentary colleagues, eventually serving sixty days in prison for the privilege.</p>
<p>Despite this record of failure, Bell was duly elected again, with Walsh coming in third behind the newly Nick Clegg-revitalised Lib Dems.</p>
<p>Last year, I had my own attempt to counter what I (and many others) saw as corruption, lies, hypocrisy and general incompetence of our local elected councillors. Standing as independent candidates, me and my two friends came fourth in the safest Labour ward in Ealing. It was good fun campaigning, and I enjoyed the physical activity of walking almost every street in my ward dropping leaflets, and the social activity of actually talking to people in person. And we helped to reduce  Labours vote share and majority (not that it makes any difference to the result).</p>
<p>Still, people voted in their thousands for two councillors who have been in post for twenty four years each, while the problems everyone complains about are the same but worse.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it was another failure to add to my CV.</p>

			 <p>Adapted from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TmqDJ4FQDxQWQR3gT3ewKvd6LUozafGlcAE_eGELC-E/mobilebasic">this template letter</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Mr Sharma,</p>
<p>My esteemed representative: I write to you today with a heavy heart, weighed down by the profound disappointment I feel in your recent actions. Your unwavering support for Israel, despite its blatant disregard for international law and its commission of war crimes, has cast a shadow over your impartiality and your ability to hold office effectively.</p>
<p>The recent decision by the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians (ICJP) to serve written notice to Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer of their intention to prosecute UK governmental officials for their role in aiding and abetting Israeli war crimes has sent shockwaves through our nation. Your name, unfortunately, stands out locally among those who have failed to condemn these atrocities, a silence that could have serious criminal ramifications.</p>
<p>I urge you to reconsider your position on this matter. The evidence of Israel&rsquo;s war crimes is overwhelming, documented by the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the International Service for Human Rights. These are not mere accusations; they are indictments of a government that has flagrantly violated international law and caused immense suffering to the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>Your constituents, including myself, have repeatedly implored you to vote for a ceasefire. You claimed to support a ceasefire, but when you had the opportunity to cast your vote to represent your constituents, you failed to do so. Worse, you claimed you did. But &ldquo;humanitarian pauses&rdquo; are not enough; they merely provide Israel with a respite to regroup and continue its assault on innocent civilians. The lack of leadership and condemnation from our elected officials is a stain on our country&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
<p>If you are unwilling to do the right thing and support a ceasefire, then I implore you to step down from your position. You have lost the trust of your constituents, and your continued presence in office is an insult to the values of peace, justice and humanity that we hold dear.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your concerned constituent,</p>
<p>David Marsden</p>

			 <p><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/11/15/curriculum-vitae.html">Following on</a> from my success delivering the news to my local community, I took a break from the world of (very part-time) work to focus on&hellip; playing in my first bands. And learning to play the guitar. Much of which came at the expense of any interest in or motivation to study, or revise for &lsquo;O&rsquo; Levels, and later &lsquo;A&rsquo; Levels.</p>
<p>Living in a small rural market town, some of my friends, and my own younger brother, in fact, had Saturday jobs <em>bush beating</em> - literally (as far as I know) beating bushes to encourage game birds to fly to their sporting deaths. Let&rsquo;s never forget that killing is a sport for our aristocracy and their hangers-on.
Famously, at the time, the host of these shootings was &ldquo;peppered in the buttocks&rdquo; by our drunken home secretary Willie Whitelaw. You couldn&rsquo;t get away with a name like that now.</p>
<p>My brother graduated from bush beating for toffs to hunt sabotage.</p>
<p>I did well enough in my &lsquo;O&rsquo; Levels (one A, eight Bs, and a C), that my maths teacher told me I would &ldquo;never amount to anything&rdquo;. He wasn&rsquo;t wrong.</p>
<p>My dad tried to motivate me after my mock &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level results by leaving me a drunken handwritten note and caricature drawing of me with an arrow pointing to it (I mean, in those days what else could he have done?) saying: &ldquo;THICK CUNT&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Then he got me what felt like a punishing summer job at the duck processing plant where he was a line supervisor. Being the boss&rsquo;s son was no fun when they put me on the killing floor. I became a vegetarian for nine years after that (although since returned to meat eating - that&rsquo;s another story).</p>
<p>I messed up my &lsquo;A&rsquo; Levels (three Es, and failed General Studies writing about the punk band Stiff Little Fingers). I was profoundly depressed, but had no one to talk to about it. Mainly because I had been brought up not to talk about or express any &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; feelings. Random people used to come up to me and say &ldquo;Cheer up, it may never happen&rdquo;, but it in my internal world, it already had.</p>
<p>Music, and playing guitar in a band, was my only outlet, but we were young and totally delusional. We were a three-piece, but believed we were the next <em>Fab Four</em>. We played a successful debut gig in Cleethorpes at <em>The Sub</em>, but instead of building on that, we immediately packed our bags and gear into a van, and drove to London to live in a series of squats in Stepney, Poplar and Limehouse.</p>
<p>An older ex-school friend was part of an anarchist community based out of a bookshop, and helped us find, gain entry to, and occasionally get the water, gas and/or electricity working. In those good old days, you could easily &ldquo;sign on&rdquo; the dole and get enough to actually live on.</p>
<p>I read and heard a lot about the politics of anarchism, which I found very attractive to my idealism. That said, I couldn&rsquo;t ever see how it would work in practice, in the real world. It would need a revolution, of course, but even then, it would need a revolution in people&rsquo;s minds and thinking first.</p>
<p>Six months living in squats, a couple of lousy gigs and a <em>demo tape</em> later, we packed our bags and returned home.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had a long and winding career in the fields of work and education. At one time, I was doing quite well, but it all got a bit too much and it&rsquo;s been a bit of a struggle since.</p>
<p>Which is a shame, because it would have been nice if things had turned out better.</p>
<p>I was never really suited to work. It&rsquo;s almost always felt like a real imposition, a drag, and a massive downer.</p>
<p>The money was never enough, and most of it went on social and recreational activities, which, looking back, were a means of self-medication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because I really did try hard to fit in and make a fist of it from the age of twenty-nine to forty-three. A mid-life crisis along with pleurisy, a collapsed lung and an empyema, followed by a thoracotomy, two consecutive nine month long frozen shoulders and that bastard GORD (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease) almost finished me off.</p>
<p>Those fourteen years working in therapeutic activities for older people with dementia, and later in training and employment for with adults with psychotic diagnoses were mostly relatively happy and relatively mostly successful (repeated ultimate catastrophic failures, aside).</p>
<p>I went from wiping arses to leading a rehabilitation centre for some of the most disadvantaged people in society.</p>
<p>Before all of that I&rsquo;d been completely lost. I never wanted to work, only to play music in a band. My first ever paid work was a paper round, but I regularly mis-delivered whenever there was a change to the round. The best thing about that job was getting to read all the different back page headlines and football stories before anyone else.</p>

			 <p>Following on from the <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/27/any-old-pots.html">pots and pans</a> incident, my wife has decreed that the bamboo plates and bowls I bought as child-safe alternatives to our regular crockery are in fact likely coated with melamine and, therefore, toxic.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s probably right, although only for hot food. I had noticed that my hot food tasted a bit funny using these, but I think they&rsquo;re fine for sandwiches and such.</p>
<p>She claims her eggs taste better (&ldquo;like childhood&rdquo;) cooked in our new stainless steel frying pan. I used it to cook an omelette for the first time yesterday, and it was undoubtedly the best omelette I&rsquo;ve ever tasted. Is that possible?</p>

			 <p>Our contract with Plusnet for telephone landline and (not full) fibre broadband ends on 25 November.
I started looking around for cheaper and/or better alternatives back in August. Not that there was anything wrong with Plusnet&rsquo;s service. In fact, compared to Sky and TalkTalk, they&rsquo;re bloody brilliant. But end of contract time usually means either a hike in price to stay loyal, or finding a new provider that offers new customers a better deal than its existing customers.</p>
<p>So, I was very pleasantly surprised to discover a <em>full</em> fibre broadband option available in my area. Apparently, a company called <em>Hey! Broadband</em> had laid there own network of fibre-optic cables in my street, meaning that we could replace our maximum 67Mb download speeds for £28 (due to go up to £54) a month with 900Mb download and upload for 99p a month for the fist six months, and then £29 a month thereafter. It sounded too good to be true!</p>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t need ten times faster broadband, but the extra bandwidth and improved coverage would be nice. It&rsquo;s not uncommon now to have one of us in a Teams meeting, another gaming on his Switch, another watching internet TV, and another doing general internet stuff. The first three, certainly, have all complained at times of lag and buffering. And even the last one has found online work meetings in my bedroom-cum-office occasionally impossible due to poor connectivity.</p>
<p>Hey! Broadband make it clear on their website that they cannot guarantee to be able to connect new customers to their network even if your address is within their network area. There may be unforeseen problems. They also make it clear that potential new customers should <em>not</em> cancel their existing broadband service before you have your new Hey! Broadband service up and running for a couple of weeks without any major issues.</p>
<p>So, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a smooth service. For one, I had no knowledge of when or where the new fibre-optic cables had been laid in our <em>cul-de-sac</em>. On the adjoining road, maybe. But I would let them sort that out. When the two engineers from Hey! Broadband&rsquo;s sub-contracted installation company arrived on 2 October things didn&rsquo;t immediately look hopeful. They were very friendly, but looked barely old enough to be out of school, and had no idea where the cables were outside to connect us up.</p>
<p>After an hour or so of looking around the local area, they came back and informed me of the good news and the bad news. The good news being that they had found a cable that we could, in theory, be connected to. The bad news being that it was on another street around the corner &ldquo;about three doors away&rdquo;. They would need to get permission from the homeowner to go into their premises and then somehow connect the cable up to our non-adjoining property. But I didn&rsquo;t have to worry, they would take care of everything, and we should hear something within five to seven working days.</p>
<p>Of course, seven working days later when I phoned them, nothing at all had been done, and in fact, they asked me to provide contact details for my &ldquo;neighbours&rdquo; and to go knock on their door and ask permission to enter their property. Which I could have done, but as I pointed out, I don&rsquo;t know them, or which house it is, and even if I did, I have no official ID to show that I&rsquo;m an engineer from Hey! Broadband. I asked to speak to a manager, and was told someone would call me back later.</p>
<p>Days passed until another engineer appeared at my door. He was even friendlier than the previous two, and old enough to have a young child of his own. He&rsquo;d already had a look around and found the cable in my next door neighbour&rsquo;s outside storage cupboard (as well as my little kid&rsquo;s trike in our storage cupboard, which he wondered if I still wanted, and if not, could he take it for his little kid?). I let him take the trike, and he promised someone would call later that day to book a new installation date.</p>
<p>No one called, although we still had the revised installation date for 31 October, and another even friendlier and slightly older engineer showed up. He actually managed to connect us up, pulling the cable through from the street next to our <em>cul-de-sac</em> (&ldquo;the longest pull&rdquo; he&rsquo;d ever done), cabling it out from our neighbour&rsquo;s storage cupboard up and over our communal porch and up our wall to our first floor flat. He drilled a hole in our wall (reassuring my wife that, no, the hole wouldn&rsquo;t let cold air or creepy crawlies in) and set us up with new full fibre broadband.</p>
<p>It turned out that he&rsquo;s self-employed, and does up to five of these installations a day at a £100 a go. He left school aged eleven unable to read or write. As he wired up our new modem, he told me how he had a habit, when younger, of setting fire to things. He went back to college to learn to read and write when his kids started coming home from school asking for help with school work, and he didn&rsquo;t want to tell them he couldn&rsquo;t do it. He didn&rsquo;t ask for a trike, either.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I met him again two days later around the corner from my big kid&rsquo;s school while we were feeding the <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/12/community-cats.html">community cats</a>. He was doing an installation there, or trying to. Unfortunately, he wasn&rsquo;t able to pull the cable through on this  occasion.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had Hey! Broadband for a week without any issues at all, and full 900Mb ethernet speeds as advertised, with wifi speeds around 150Mb down and 250Mb up.  No telephone landline anymore, which is no loss, as we only ever used it to answer scam calls. I&rsquo;m now a [Hey!

To a very wet and wild north-east Lincolnshire right by the sea (or the Humber Estuary). With no wifi, and very poor data connectivity. In a tin can caravan.</p>
<p>But we all had fun, and the kids got to spend time with their grandparents who live nearby. And use their wifi.</p>
<p>On the night before we left I met up with a couple of my oldest and best friends, Murray and Aaron, who I hadn&rsquo;t seen for ten (Aaron) and thirty (!) (Murray) years. It was really great to have a couple of pints and talk shit with them, just like the old days, as if it was only yesterday.</p>

			 <p>Frank was my great grandfather on my dad&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>I only met him a couple of times. One time, me and my brother were made to wear the most ridiculous and embarrassing outfits, and we just felt very uncomfortable and ill-at-ease meeting this very old man from another time.</p>
<p>He was born in the early 1901. So he must have been 80 or so when we met him. Not so old these days, but back then he really was like a dinosaur, or a fossil.</p>
<p>I remember a couple of stories about him. After the Great War, when he was a young man with a new wife and baby daughter (my grandmother), he had to walk twenty-five miles to work, where he would labour hard for sixteen hours before walking home again, only to be brutally murdered by his father before going to bed and getting up the next morning to do the same thing over and over again. Well, he certainly had to work hard, just to survive and raise a family.</p>
<p>Life was no doubt much harder then than any of us can really imagine, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKHFZBUTA4k">you try and tell that to the young people of today. Would they believe you? No!</a></p>
<p>My great grandmother, Ellen, was committed to Lancaster Asylum some time after my grandmother Freda was born. I don&rsquo;t know what the reason was, but it&rsquo;s possible it was because she was suffering from what would now be recognised as post-natal depression.</p>
<p>In those days, it was a life sentence, not to mention the shame it brought upon the family.</p>
<p>Frank divorced Ellen and married &ldquo;Auntie Florrie&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know if Florrie was actually Ellen&rsquo;s sister, but it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Freda never forgot her mum, and secretly visited her whenever she could.</p>
<p>When Frank got the cancer that would kill him, Freda took him in and looked after him in her bed until he died.</p>

			 <p>My three and a half year old is going through that stage where he doesn&rsquo;t want to get dressed in the morning to go to nursery.</p>
<p>I remember with my oldest lad some mornings I used to be in tears trying to get him ready.</p>
<p>Fortunately, their mum is now working from home and has taken on this task with the little one. My main job now is to remind my nine year old to &ldquo;sit at the table and eat your breakfast&rdquo; every two minutes.</p>
<p>Up until a couple of weeks ago, my secondary role was as assistant little kid dresser. I would sit him on my knee with one arm around his chest holding his arms down, while trying to hold a leg or a foot so that his mum could forcibly put on his underpants, socks and trousers without him kicking or pulling them off again.</p>
<p>Mum has now found a much more kid-friendly method, with no tears.</p>
<p>Underpants are now butterflies, fluttering around looking for somewhere to land. Socks, of course, make great foot-puppets. Trousers are caterpillars crawling on a tree branch, and his coat is a big brown bear who just wants a hug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still exhausting, but it makes the morning a little bit happier for everyone.</p>

			 <p>My nine year old had a trim the other day. No one else can really tell, but his massive afro isn&rsquo;t quite so massive as it was last week, and certainly a little less knotted.</p>
<p>Should make it easier to <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/02/noodle.html">get his swimming cap on</a>.</p>
<p>His mum cuts his hair. We took him to a barber&rsquo;s when he was younger, and I literally had to hold him down while the barber did his work.</p>
<p>I never liked having my hair cut. I used to have very thick curly hair as a boy, although not an afro. My mum used to use what she called <em>thinning scissors</em>, which were kind of like scissors with teeth. It felt like having my hair pulled out.</p>
<p>I think as kids we&rsquo;re just so much more sensitive to all these things. And my lad&rsquo;s hair is a core part of his identity. (When he was younger, he used to identify as a lion, so his hair was his mane.)</p>
<p>I managed to overcome my fear of hair cutting as an adult, and even found a reliable barber pre-covid. Since the pandemic, like many others, I bought a pair of clippers and do it myself now.</p>

			 <p>Inevitably, as I sit here in the cafe next to my son&rsquo;s swimming lesson, <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/09/29/human-shield.html">unable to drink coffee because the cafe</a> is permanently closed, my mind wanders and starts thinking about coffee.</p>
<p>For most of my adult life, I&rsquo;ve started the day with a cup of tea. Regular English breakfast tea. PG Tips, Tetley. Milk and sugar.</p>
<p>Tea was always my preferred drink, but I did like a cup of instant coffee or two later in the morning, but only if it was one I liked. I wasn&rsquo;t fond of Nescafe or the other regular blends.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I switched to Rooibos (redbush) tea, and never went back. I also started appreciating real coffee made on a French press, and later got my own Aeropress. What really sealed the coffee deal, was discovering fresh coffee beans that aren&rsquo;t burnt (Pact Coffee).</p>
<p>About three years ago, I backed a Kickstarter campaign to build an affordable, portable espresso maker, <em>CoffeeJack</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not one of those people who backs a lot of these types of things, although it wasn&rsquo;t my first or last. I understand that it&rsquo;s not like ordering from Amazon or anywhere else. You&rsquo;re backing a project with money in the hope that it&rsquo;s successful and that you end up with a product that works as described. There&rsquo;s no guarantee.</p>
<p>Now, <em>CoffeeJack</em> delivered about three years after they got my money. Which is a long time! They had lots of problems along the way, including, of course, the covid pandemic. So fair play to them for getting their project finished at all. And it was worth the wait, in my opinion. They produced exactly what they promised, and for six months I had two cups a day of the best coffee I&rsquo;ve ever tasted.</p>
<p>Sadly, just when I thought I&rsquo;d cracked it, I cracked the bayonet on my <em>CoffeJack</em>. Too much pressure, to quote The Selector.</p>

			 <p>Last week, my boss asked me to produce a professional looking ten page job profile for a potential new appointment.</p>
<p>He provided me with an example from another employer, and asked me to use the same format.</p>
<p>He wanted me to find some suitable photographs &ldquo;online&rdquo; to use.</p>
<p>This was all outside of his skillset.</p>
<p>And mine.</p>
<p>He wanted it &ldquo;by tomorrow&rdquo; (Wednesday), and gave me the text he&rsquo;d written for the first page, as well as the headings he wanted to use for the remaining pages.</p>
<p>The formatted example he&rsquo;d given me was a pdf. I was very pleased to discover that Adobe now provides a free pdf to Word conversion, which certainly made my job easier.</p>
<p>It was easy enough to find photographs, of course, but not so much photographs that are free to use. My boss later told me he wasn&rsquo;t worried about that, as he &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t using them for commercial purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day (Wednesday), my boss emailed to say he would send me the final nine pages of text he still hadn&rsquo;t written &ldquo;tomorrow morning&rdquo; (Thursday), and that &ldquo;we&rdquo; would &ldquo;populate&rdquo; the template document then.</p>
<p>While I was eating lunch the next day (Thursday), his email arrived leaving me two hours to put the whole thing together. I didn&rsquo;t think it would be enough time, but just got on with it.</p>
<p>Two hours later, I still had two pages to do, but had to collect my kids from nursery and school, make their tea (or dinner, as they call it), and get them in the bath. I managed to finish it later while they watched TV.</p>

			 <p>Just around the corner from my lad&rsquo;s school by the canal is a <em>cul-de-sac</em> which is home to some &ldquo;community cats&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Having spoken to a few of the people who live there, it seems that none of the seven or eight cats and kittens have homes or owners, but are looked after by the people who live there.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not strays, but they&rsquo;re not feral, either. They&rsquo;re community cats.</p>
<p>These cats have been around for as long as I can remember (which admittedly isn&rsquo;t so long these days), but it&rsquo;s only in the last few weeks that they have become of growing interest to my lad and some of his friends on their way to and from school.</p>
<p>What started off as simply &ldquo;aw, look there&rsquo;s a cat&rdquo;, has now become a financial investment in daily supplies of cat food, and extra time in the morning and afternoon to stop, feed and stroke Tab, Abby, Popcorn, Tiny, Smoky, Toffee and one or two others I can&rsquo;t remember the names of.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of sharing a few photos of these cats with my cat obsessed mother, who was very upset that they don&rsquo;t have warm, dry homes and owners who overfeed them with specially bought and cooked fish. I&rsquo;ve tried to reassure her that they look healthy (shiny coats), well-fed and looked after.</p>

			 <p>There seems to be a co-ordinated drive to obliterate Palestine, and Palestinians, from the map.</p>

<p>Nothing justifies carpet-bombing innocent people - mostly women and children.</p>
<p>Nothing justifies cutting off their supplies of electricity, water, food, fuel.</p>

<p>These are war crimes.</p>
<p>Now, our fascist government is attempting to outlaw any expression of support for the people of Gaza and Palestine.</p>
<p>Fully supported and enabled by our fascist &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; party.</p>
<p>The Labour Mayor of London helped to spread what turned out to be fake news about an alleged anti-Semitic attack on a Jewish-owned shop. Known liar Luciana Berger, MP, did the same. As did countless other &ldquo;sensible, adult centrists&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not anti-Semitic to support the people of Palestine in their long struggle for freedom from Israel&rsquo;s oppression.</p>

			 <p>We used to play in the street outside our home as kids growing up in the 70s. In rural Lincolnshire. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t a main road, it was the road on our council estate. Pretty much everyone had a car, and many of the houses had their own garage.</p>
<p>In London, or Greater London, it&rsquo;s generally not safe for kids to play in the street, although we&rsquo;re lucky where we are that our little <em>cul-de-sac</em> can double-up as a relatively safe enough play area most of the time.</p>
<p>The road next to us is an HGV Access Road, thanks to our local ward councillor and current council leader.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely NOT safe for kids to play in at all.</p>
<p>Not until the Water Company came along. For the past two or three weeks, they have closed part of the road where my sons' friends live to clear the pipes of wet wipes, sanitary products, fat and oil.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve dug a massive hole in the road, which I&rsquo;ve told my nine year old is <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/06/class.html"><em>The Pit of Tartarus</em></a>. It&rsquo;s all barricaded off, with heavy machinery, waste skips and various bits of equipment.</p>
<p>So the road is now a no through road, with access only for residents and deliveries.</p>
<p>My kids and their friends have really enjoyed playing out in the street whenever they can, thanks also to our &ldquo;Indian Summer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of drivers who ignore (or don&rsquo;t see?) the signs telling them the road is closed, and drive down it anyway. My job was mostly to tell them, &ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t drive on the pavement. Can&rsquo;t you see there are kids playing? Plus, it&rsquo;s a pavement. This isn&rsquo;t the Wild West!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, everyone was reasonable enough when challenged to back away, turnaround and drive around following the &ldquo;diverted traffic&rdquo; signs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my job was made redundant by the older kids in the group, who took it upon themselves to relieve me of my onerous duties. They barricaded the pavements with spare cones, and now they marshall the traffic. Much more effective!</p>

			 <p><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/04/distraction.html">Thinking about Maths at school</a>, got me thinking about the origin and meaning of <em>class</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a classic word, and means so many different things depending on the context in which it&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>Its Roman <a href="https://latin-dictionary.net/definition/10289/classis-classis">origin</a> relates to the dividing up of society, or groups of people for war or military objectives.</p>
<p>My Latin teacher at school was obsessed with lining up the desks and chairs at the end of each lesson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caecilius pater est&rdquo; is the only Latin I can remember.</p>
<p>We rebelled, and persuaded our headteacher to teach us <em>Classics in Translation</em> instead. That was fun. Reading, and learning all about ancient Greek philosophy and mythology.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s easy to get distracted.</p>
<p>My nine year old told his mum last night that he was so distracted by thoughts in his head at school that the teacher gave him a blank piece of paper and a pen to &ldquo;download&rdquo; everything in his mind.</p>
<p>All he could think about was <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>Nintendo</em>.</p>
<p>Well, it <em>was</em> Maths.</p>
<p>I always liked Maths at school. Mainly because there was no homework, or writing, or revision to do. Either I knew it or I didn&rsquo;t. And I mostly did, up until A Levels.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;Pure Maths&rdquo; teacher told me I would never amount to anything. I guess he was right about that.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;Applied Maths&rdquo; teacher tried to make lessons more memorable by telling us a story about a man who grew jellies in his garden. I guess <em>he</em> was right about <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>I got a B grade in O Level Maths. If I&rsquo;d actually made any kind of effort I could probably have got an A. Things could have been oh so different!</p>

			 <p>My nine year old is on week three of his school swimming lessons.</p>
<p>Prior to the first lesson, he was very anxious about getting his hair wet, and getting his nose under the water. This, despite the fact that he absolutely <em>loved</em> the sea and the pool on our holiday last month (and last year, and the year before that).</p>
<p>We bought him a swimming cap, which everyone has to wear in any case. He&rsquo;s got massive natural afro hair, so the first three swimming caps we bought were too small.</p>
<p>He was very anxious about putting on his swimming cap for the lessons. I said I would help him, as <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/09/29/human-shield.html">I would be there</a>, but of course, that never happened as they all just marched straight into the changing rooms leaving me alone with my coffee-free café.</p>
<p>Fortunately, one of the teaching staff helps him with his cap.</p>
<p>So he keeps his hair dry. And after the second lesson last week, he came home and informed us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>he put his nose under the water and survived</li>
<li>he wants to go swimming at the weekend</li>
<li>he wants a swimming &ldquo;noodle&rdquo;.</li>

			 <p>The school asked for a parent to volunteer to accompany the children to their weekly swimming class.</p>
<p>They said I could sit in the café and drink coffee. No swimming required. I volunteered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically a fourth chaperone, in addition to the three teaching staff. I simply accompany the children to their swimming class, and back.</p>
<p>The class teacher gave me the two page risk assessment to read on the first morning, and I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself to stand either at the back of the line of kids, or in the middle, depending on where there is a gap of supervising adults. I try to act as a human shield on zebra crossings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>While the kids are having their swimming lesson, I sit in the adjacent café (which is permanently closed, by the way) with my distraction-free writing device. I get an hour a week now to write in peace. It&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/09/20/the-door.html">Last week, we had a new front door fitted</a>.</p>
<p>That morning, I took it upon myself to prepare a bolognese before the doormen arrived so that we didn&rsquo;t need to get in each other&rsquo;s way, and so that we had something to eat for lunch for the next few days.</p>
<p>I make my bolognese in a 12&quot; frying pan and cover it with a grease splatter fine mesh to let it cook slowly for a few hours. When the doormen arrived, that&rsquo;s exactly what my bolognese was doing.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t realise, until it was too late, is that the dust from their drilling and general doormen work was settling on the stove top in front of my bolognese on the back of the stove.</p>
<p>This was brought to my attention by my wife, who was already in a state of being <em>very upset</em> by the new door hanging to the right and not the left like her old door.</p>
<p>I inspected the bolognese and the splatter mesh cover carefully for signs of white paint dust similar the to very evident white paint dust sitting on top of the stove.</p>
<p>I honestly couldn&rsquo;t see anything, although the bolognese did have quite a sheen (although this was after I&rsquo;d just added some milk to it).</p>
<p>Anyway, my wife refused to eat it, so I had no choice, really, but to eat all of it over the next four days.</p>
<p>If anything, it tasted a bit spicier than normal, not in a bad way, and I have not grown any extra fingers, yet.</p>

			 <p>The door was old, but it still functioned as a door. It opened and closed, and kept us safe and warm.</p>
<p>As it got older, it got a bit cranky and quirky.</p>
<p>The spring-loaded closing mechanism no longer worked as it should. If you were a small person, a cat or a delivery driver, you had to beware this big old heavy door slamming shut whether you were in, out, or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Sometimes the lock wouldn&rsquo;t work at all and you had to hope there was someone inside who would let you in. Mostly, it required a certain knack to unlock it. Which kept kids out, and ensured extra exercise for grown-ups getting up off the sofa to let kids in.</p>
<p>One day, the housing association&rsquo;s sub-contractors came to take our door away. It was a fire safety hazard, according to a very expensive risk assessment they carried out several years ago in the wake of the Grenfell Fire.</p>
<p>They came, they saw(ed), they removed our old door in five minutes flat, leaving a gaping hole.</p>
<p>The new door is sleek and fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a like for like replacement,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip; the handle is on the right hand side,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the door opens to the left not the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very unhappy,&rdquo; said my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not magnetic,&rdquo; said my nine year old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s they keyhole?&rdquo; my three year old didn&rsquo;t say, but the question must surely have been going through his mind as he tried to unlock the door on the wrong (right) side with the new key.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I got a <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/19099/to_cash_2_august_2023_from_cllr_peter_mason.pdf">reply to my open letter to Peter Mason</a>[pdf], Leader of Ealing Council, and one of my local ward councillors.</p>
<p>Slightly oddly, he addressed it not just to me, but also to CASH (<a href="https://southallandhayescleanair.org.uk/">Clean Air for Southall and Hayes</a>, and my neighbour Angela Fonso (who heads up the campaign group. You can see a record of all Mason&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/6227/southall_gasworks_correspondence"><em>Letters to CASH</em></a>, if you&rsquo;re interested in the history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also submitted two <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/user/david_marsden_2/requests">Freedom of Information requests</a>(FOIs) to try to get answers, as I didn&rsquo;t expect a reply (as he has never replied directly to any of my previous questions).</p>
<p>The FOI response on the developer Berkeley Group&rsquo;s sponsorship of council events <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/1000452/response/2374307/attach/html/5/FOI%20Response%2023%200820%20FINAL.pdf.html">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mayor of Ealing had sought sponsors for his Pride reception. Berkeley responded to this request
and offered a £500 contribution to the event. However, while the offer was publicly acknowledged, the
money was never accepted or received because the Council is committed to not accept sponsorship
from Berkeley for corporate events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The FOI response on the council&rsquo;s relationship with developers was, to my mind, wholly unsatisfactory and generated <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/ealing_councils_relationships_wi#outgoing-1498781">a third FOI</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, plain English perhaps, it took two years to put in place any formal procedure to uphold the Leader&rsquo;s stated aims, and there is literally nothing to see to evidence that councillors are following the procedure, or will do. And the fact that there is nothing to see to evidence your claims is, you claim, an indication of the council&rsquo;s commitment to transparency?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s my reply to his reply (via his Head of Cabinet Office).</p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks for passing on Cllr Mason&rsquo;s response. Please pass this on to him.</p>
<p>I appreciate Cllr Mason&rsquo;s honesty in acknowledging that the Mayor accepted Berkeley Group&rsquo;s offer of sponsorship, contrary to council policy.</p>
<p>I also appreciate that the Mayor, councillors and officers have been reminded of the policy going forward.</p>
<p>However, the Mayor&rsquo;s original tweet still stands, published, thanking Berkeley Group for sponsoring the event.</p>
<p>I would like to know why this tweet has not been retracted or clarified, because it continues to give what I am now asked to believe by Cllr Mason is a wholly misleading statement of Ealing Council policy, as well as free good marketing publicity for what is a proscribed organisation. That&rsquo;s even worse than accepting sponsorship. (I hope that Berkeley Group were asked to donate their sponsorship directly to one of the Mayor&rsquo;s charities instead.)</p>
<p>I would like Cllr Mason, the council leader, to ensure that the Mayor removes and publicly clarifies and apologises for his tweet, and mistakenly accepting Berkeley&rsquo;s offer. I would like him to explain why it was a mistake and why it&rsquo;s necessary to apologise.</p>
<p>In Southall, we&rsquo;ve suffered, as Cllr Mason recently acknowledged in <a href="https://youtu.be/M_vj2l2_JuY">one of his self-promotion videos</a>, six years of &ldquo;many, many terrible smells and certainly some bad chemicals released into the environment&rdquo;, which have undoubtedly caused long-term mental and physical health problems for residents young and old.</p>
<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t need to remind anyone that Southall is home to by far the largest South Asian and Black community in Ealing, and the lowest average incomes, who are among the most vulnerable to the adverse health impacts of these &ldquo;bad chemicals&rdquo;. In addition, Southall residents live with some of the worst air pollution in Ealing from traffic congestion, FM Conway asphalt plant, and non-permitted incinerators. Some environmental justice campaigners describe this as a &ldquo;sacrifice zone&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s very hurtful, insulting and offensive to people in Southall, who have suffered and sacrificed so much, to see the new Mayor break the council leader&rsquo;s pledge, and offer no public retraction, acknowledgement, clarification or apology. It&rsquo;s as if his words have no consequences. It&rsquo;s as if South Asian and Black lives don&rsquo;t matter, or South Asian and Blacks don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>I would also question how the offer of sponsorship came about. We all know that the person responsible for &ldquo;Community Liaison&rdquo; for Berkeley Group is Jags Sanghera, who was a Labour Party councillor candidate in last year&rsquo;s local elections. Why is Jags, who came close to being elected as a councillor, offering sponsorship to the Mayor? It does make me wonder if councillors (and prospective councillors) have ever been told of the council policy, and when? Not to mention the obvious conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Will Cllr Mason establish a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy for accepting sponsorship, gifts and hospitality going forward (and, perhaps, apply it retrospectively)?</p>
<p>With regard to Cllr Jassal&rsquo;s participation in Berkeley Group&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Engagement&rdquo; steering group, I&rsquo;d have more confidence in Cllr Mason&rsquo;s assertion that this is to hold them to account if the group wasn&rsquo;t set up and controlled by Berkeley Group and Jags Sanghera. Were CASH invited to be members? Was I? No. Why not? Because as far as I can see, we are among the only people who do consistently try to hold Berkeley Group to account, and their relationship with the council.</p>
<p>As Cllr Mason addressed his reply to me to Angela and CASH as well, I&rsquo;ve copied them in to this.</p>
<p>Yours&hellip;</p>

<hr>
<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>In your <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/16565/to_cash_12_july_2021.pdf">open letter</a> to Angela Fonso and CASH dated 12 July 2021, you pledged that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;[t]he Council will not take any further sponsorship from Berkeley Group.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was shocked, therefore, to see the new Mayor of Ealing <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorofEaling/status/1674705592974286850">tweet</a> to thank Berkeley Group for their sponsorship of an event he organised and hosted.</p>
<p>In your letter mentioned above, you also stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am determined to ensure that the Council’s future dealings with developers are transparent, arms-length and do not give rise to concerns that it is privileging the relationship with developers above that with residents.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was dismayed, therefore, to discover (from Berkeley marketing material, hand delivered, photo attached) that a Southall councillor (Cllr Jassal) and a council officer (Evelyn Gloyn, Ealing&rsquo;s Community Engagement Manager) are members of Berkeley Group&rsquo;s new &ldquo;community engagement&rdquo; steering group. This clear conflict of interest with the health and wellbeing of residents who Cllr Jassal is elected to represent does not appear on <a href="https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/mgListDeclarationsOfInterest.aspx?UID=365">Cllr Jassal&rsquo;s declaration of interests on the council website</a>. Cllr Jassal and Evelyn Gloyn are literally standing shoulder to shoulder with Berkeley Group, not at &ldquo;arms-length&rdquo;, as you pledged two years ago.</p>
<p>I note also that various councillors have continued to attend Berkeley Group&rsquo;s marketing events (sold as &ldquo;community events&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I know you have a very strong commitment to leading an open and transparent administration, and so, therefore, I ask you to tell me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the monetary value of &ldquo;sponsorship&rdquo; Ealing Council (councillors, officers, Mayor) has accepted from Berkeley Group since your letter of 12 July 2021, and for which events?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Ealing Council policy for councillors, officers, Mayor, for accepting sponsorship, hospitality and gifts from developers, and to ensure that the Council will not take any further sponsorship from Berkeley Group?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the action you will take to prevent councillors, officers, Mayor accepting sponsorship, hospitality and gifts from developers in future, and publicly returning sponsorship already received from Berkeley Group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Ealing Council policy for councillors, officers, Mayor, to ensure future dealings with developers are transparent, arms-length and do not give rise to concerns that it is privileging the relationship with developers above that with residents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the action you will take to prevent councillors, officers, Mayor privileging the relationship with developers above that with residents, and publicly disengaging from Berkeley Group&rsquo;s profit-driven marketing schemes dressed up as &ldquo;community engagement&rdquo;?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>David Marsden</p>

<p>The health risks from remediating Southall Gasworks on site in the open air are significant. The site is highly contaminated with a variety of hazardous chemicals, including benzene, naphthalene, VOCs, PAHs, heavy metals, &ldquo;blue billy&rdquo; and asbestos. These chemicals can cause a variety of health problems, including cancer, respiratory problems, neurological problems, and birth defects. The local community is mostly of south Asian and African heritage, and it is known that people with this heritage can be genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. This means that they are more likely to experience health problems from exposure to naphthalene.</p>
<p>If levels of benzene and naphthalene are consistently above the legal safety guidelines, and local residents complain of eye, nose and throat irritation, new or worsening of respiratory conditions and infections, or other health problems as a result of odour and air pollution, the developer and regulatory authorities should take immediate action to protect the health of the community. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stopping the remediation work until the levels of contamination can be brought down to safe levels.</li>
<li>Providing air filters and other protective equipment to residents who live near the site.</li>
<li>Evacuation of residents who are most at risk.</li>
<li>Conducting a health study of the community to assess the impact of the contamination.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer and regulatory authorities have a responsibility to protect the health of the community. If they fail to take action, they could be held liable for any health problems that result from the contamination.</p>
<p>Here are some additional information about the health risks of the chemicals found at Southall Gasworks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benzene:</strong> Benzene is a colorless, flammable liquid that is used in a variety of products, including gasoline, paints, and solvents. It is a known carcinogen, and it can also cause leukemia, anemia, and other health problems.</li>
<li><strong>Naphthalene:</strong> Naphthalene is a white, crystalline solid that is used in mothballs and other products. It is also a known carcinogen, and it can cause respiratory problems, skin irritation, and other health problems.</li>
<li><strong>VOCs:</strong> Volatile organic compounds are a group of chemicals that can easily evaporate into the air. They can come from a variety of sources, including gasoline, paints, and solvents. VOCs can cause a variety of health problems, including respiratory problems, headaches, nausea, and cancer.</li>
<li><strong>PAHs:</strong> Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed when organic matter is burned. They are found in a variety of sources, including gasoline, coal, and tobacco smoke. PAHs can cause cancer, respiratory problems, and other health problems.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy metals:</strong> Heavy metals are a group of metals that are toxic to humans and other animals. They can come from a variety of sources, including mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. Heavy metals can cause a variety of health problems, including cancer, neurological problems, and birth defects.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Blue billy&rdquo;:</strong> Blue billy is a type of asbestos that is found in coal tar. Asbestos is a known carcinogen, and it can cause a variety of health problems, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that the health risks of exposure to these chemicals vary depending on the level of exposure, the length of exposure, and the individual&rsquo;s health. If you are concerned about your health after being exposed to these chemicals, you should see a doctor.</p>

			 <p>I asked <a href="bard.google.com">Google Bard</a> to advise me on a local matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the leader of Ealing Council. I have received more than 250 reports about a BAD odour nuisance and air pollution from the remediation of the highly contaminated Southall Gasworks land. We had a public meeting where 250 angry residents complained about health problems as a result of the air pollution, including eye, nose and throat irritation, respiratory problems and infections, and even cancer and death of loved ones. The developer has implemented increased odour suppression to the satisfaction of the Environment Agency. I&rsquo;ve given residents three numbers to call, each of which takes twenty minutes or more to get through and treats every report as an isolated incident. By the time my investigating officers arrive hours later the smell has gone. I&rsquo;ve accepted over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from the developer. What should I do?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What you should do:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resign as leader of Ealing Council.</strong> Accepting over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from the developer creates a clear conflict of interest. You are no longer in a position to objectively represent the interests of the residents of Ealing.</li>
<li><strong>Publicly apologize to the residents of Ealing for your actions.</strong> Acknowledge that you have made a mistake and that you are truly sorry for the harm that you have caused.</li>
<li><strong>Refund the developer all of the gifts and hospitality that you have accepted.</strong> This will demonstrate that you are serious about addressing the conflict of interest and that you are committed to acting in the best interests of the residents of Ealing.</li>
<li><strong>Work with the developer to find a solution to the air pollution problem.</strong> This may involve additional odour suppression measures, compensation for residents who have been harmed by the air pollution, or other measures.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure that residents have a way to report air pollution problems quickly and easily.</strong> This could involve setting up a dedicated hotline or website, or making it easier for residents to contact the council.</li>
<li><strong>Investigate all reports of air pollution promptly and thoroughly.</strong> This will help to ensure that residents are taken seriously and that their concerns are addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the public informed about the progress of your efforts to address the air pollution problem.</strong> This will help to build trust and confidence between the council and the residents of Ealing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What you should not do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not deny or downplay the seriousness of the air pollution problem.</strong> The residents of Ealing are suffering, and they deserve to be taken seriously.</li>
<li><strong>Do not try to cover up your conflict of interest.</strong> The public has a right to know about any potential conflicts of interest that could affect the way you make decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Do not try to blame the developer or anyone else for the air pollution problem.</strong> As the leader of Ealing Council, you are ultimately responsible for the health and safety of the residents of your borough.</li>
<li><strong>Do not give up on finding a solution to the air pollution problem.</strong> The residents of Ealing deserve to live in a clean and healthy environment, and you have a responsibility to do everything you can to make that happen.</li>
</ul>

When he started, he couldn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t read.</p>

<p>Wow, I’ve never been asked that! Not what am I reading, but what am I reading FOR?</p>
<p>Well, goddamnit, ya stumped me!</p>
<p>Why do I read?</p>

			 <p>I visited the Palace of Westminster this week with my big kid on an educational school trip.</p>
<p>It was a very cold, wet and windy day, and we were patriotically under-dressed and sans brollies. We took a good lashing from Mother Nature.</p>
<p>The tour of the Houses of Parliament was cool, dry and stuffy, and the little radio headphones we were given so we could hear better were sub-optimal.</p>
<p>The House of Commons was closed to ordinary commoners like us, but the House of Lords was open as long as we refrained from parking our cold, wet and windy working class bums on our superiors' &lsquo;holier than thou&rsquo; red leather benches. Police guards armed with sub-machine guns would forcibly remove any insubordinate eight or nine year olds, and presumably march them straight to the Tower of London (or shoot them dead if they looked like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/17/de-menezes-family-call-cressida-dick-barred-from-leading-met">Jean Charles de Menezes</a>.</p>
<p>The children asked a police officer why he carried a gun, and they learned it is to keep them safe. That may be true, but I didn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> safer, and there were no <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/01/police-must-win-back-public-confidence-after-sarah-everard-case-says-minister">buses to flag down</a>.</p>
<p>The children learned that murderous megalomaniac misogynist King Henry VIII is still held in very high regard in these parts, despite beheading two of his six wives, and creating a new religion and laws to divorce two more.</p>
<p>I asked the children how the chamber of the House of Lords made them feel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had lunch across the road outside Portcullis House where we could shelter a little from the wind and rain. Portcullis House is where elected Members of Parliament (MP) and their staff have offices. There were lots of posh-looking mostly white men going in and out and getting frisked inside by more armed guards. Out in the cold, we shared our lunch with toothless and homeless Len, who we found sleeping in the doorway next to us, and looking very wet and cold. Len told us he was &ldquo;a midget, a dwarf from Burnley&rdquo; and he&rsquo;d come to London to sort his life out, but his marriage failed and here he was. He was very pleased to have a homemade tuna mayonnaise sandwich, a juice drink and a satsuma. My wife told me off when we got home, claiming that he will have sold or exchanged the sandwich for drugs.</p>
<p>We waited for our own MP <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2022/02/11/trigger-vote-for.html">Virendra Sharma</a> to come and meet us as the teachers had arranged. No one knew what he looked like, so they asked me as my lad told them I had met him before (which is true). Then we played a game &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sharma?&rdquo; until he appeared. Mr Sharma thanked the kids for coming to meet him, and asked them who wanted his job. His two assistants took photographs.</p>
<p>We ended the day by getting drenched walking up to see Downing Street and the Horse Guards Parade. Downing Street was, of course, guarded by more armed police and totally inaccessible to us ordinary folk, and the parade smelled of horse shit.</p>

			 <p>Showing my age this morning.</p>
<p>I &lsquo;heard&rsquo; my wife say, &ldquo;My First Vegetables!&rdquo; as our little boy chose a new TV show to watch.</p>
<p>I &lsquo;saw&rsquo; a picture of a broccoli on the screen. I got a broccoli from the fridge (along with some carrots and a cauliflower) to show him and keep it real. 🥦🥬🥕</p>
<p>Turns out the show is called <a href="www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000t8l3">&ldquo;My First Festivals, Series 2: 4. St Patrick’s Day&rdquo;</a>, and the picture was a shamrock. ☘️</p>
<p>At least the vegetables were the same colour as the Irish flag! 🇮🇪</p>

			 <p>Ealing Council&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7039/ealing_council_air_quality_strategy_2020-30">draft Air Quality Strategy</a> is a 64 page document together with a 40 page <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7038/ealing_draft_air_quality_action_plan_2022-2027">Action Plan</a>, and the consultation period runs until 30 January 2023. It&rsquo;s taken me the best part of six weeks, all my spare time over Christmas and New Year, to get through it all, make notes and cross-reference to try to make sense of it all and offer some feedback.</p>
<p>Really, there must be a much longer consultation period if Ealing Council is genuinely interested in residents' views.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of what the key points of interest are for me, and in particular in relation to Southall, where I live and work. My additional suggestions are <strong>in bold</strong>, and my comments and questions in <em>italics</em>.</p>
<h4 id="warning">Warning</h4>
<p>This is a LONG post. I&rsquo;ve tried to break it into sections to make it easier to read.</p>
<h4 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h4>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t claim to be an expert, other than through experience. I am just an ordinary resident living in the midst of four major industrial and construction site polluters for several years. I have campaigned alongside my family, neighbours and friends for clean air after my then nearly four year old said he wanted fresh air not stinky air. He&rsquo;d been hospitalised three times when he was two and diagnosed with asthma. We soon discovered people who had lost loved ones, had heart attacks, ectopic pregnancies, cancer, all attributed to the foul petrochemical stink.</em></p>
<p><em>I welcome any corrections.</em></p>
<h1 id="my-summary">My Summary</h1>
<p><strong>If Ealing is serious about &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; inequalities, action must be targeted to protect vulnerable people in Southall to reduce air pollution and its impact on the health of its large, mostly economically deprived and non-white population.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Strategy and Plan must target children and older people, people with lung conditions, and pregnant women: outside schools and school run hours. The Council must question if it is ethical to promote active travel in Southall when it knows that it is a high pollution area and that most of its population is particularly vulnerable to its adverse health impacts.</strong></p>
<p>The draft strategy and action plan don&rsquo;t do this at all.</p>

<p><em>To begin, I think it’s fantastic that Ealing Council has stated its vision for clean air for all Ealing residents, in alignment with that of local residents’ campaign group <a href="https://southallandhayescleanair.org.uk/about/" title="About page for campaign group Clean Air for Southall and Hayes">Clean Air for Southall and Hayes</a> (CASH).</em></p>
<p><em>CASH has been <a href="https://www.change.org/p/cleanair-for-southall-and-hayes-stop-berkeleygroupuk-s-southallwaterside-polluting-our-kids-southalllivesmatter" title="Link to Change.org petition started by CASH in 2018">asking for clean air for residents in Southall and Hayes since 2018</a>.</em></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-strategy-and-action-plan">Summary of the Strategy and Action Plan</h2>
<p>Ealing&rsquo;s draft air quality strategy&rsquo;s five stated priorities are to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce road traffic emissions</li>
<li>Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning</li>
<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments</li>
<li>Invest in green infrastructure</li>
<li>Raise awareness of air quality</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It would be useful to see the strategy and action plan follow the same structure with clear definitions of terms, and specific and detailed aims and objectives for each priority, along with baseline air pollution levels and equalities data for each in order to monitor and measure impact.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/8fc38abd8c.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport"></p>
<p>Somewhat confusingly, the action plan groups its actions into six categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Emissions from Developments and Buildings</li>
<li>Public health and awareness raising</li>
<li>Delivery servicing and freight</li>
<li>Borough fleet actions</li>
<li>Localised solutions</li>
<li>Cleaner transport</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This maybe because they are copied and pasted from the previous <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/4240/air_quality_action_plan_aqap">2017-22 action plan</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>It would be better for understanding, monitoring and evaluation to have consistency and coherence between the two documents, updating the action plan where necessary to reflect this.</strong></p>
<p>Also somewhat confusingly, Ealing&rsquo;s draft air quality strategy has nine stated goals, starting with the obvious. I&rsquo;ll say more on these later:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Improve air quality</li>
<li>Tackling the climate crisis</li>
<li>Fighting inequality</li>
<li>Protect biodiversity</li>
<li>Protect health and wellbeing</li>
<li>Raise public awareness</li>
<li>Promote sustainable infrastructure</li>
<li>Support the transition to clean energy</li>
<li>Creating good jobs</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inequalities">Inequalities</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/30e2e26fd7.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint"></p>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk in Ealing&rsquo;s air quality strategy about being inclusive and &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; (&ldquo;reducing&rdquo; would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; (&ldquo;exhaust trail&rdquo; might be more apt?). I&rsquo;m not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="public-health-policy">Public Health Policy</h3>
<p>The strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks.</p>
<p><em>When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action</a>), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we&rsquo;ll see later, promoting active travel.</em></p>
<p>In contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio</a>).</p>
<p>*There&rsquo;s obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Good Growth</a>), and social policy (<a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Tackling Inequalities</a>).</p>
<p><strong>It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.</strong></p>
<p>The strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant.</p>
<p><em>Ealing&rsquo;s <a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profiles/2019/E09000009.html?area-name=Ealing">Health Profile from 2019</a> puts that figure in some context:</em></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/79dfdefa37.png" alt="Screenshot of Ealing&rsquo;s 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer" title="Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="air-pollution-in-ealing">Air Pollution in Ealing</h2>
<h3 id="pollution-sources">Pollution Sources</h3>
<p>The strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy.</p>
<p>Those most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women.</p>
<p><strong>It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo;, especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).</strong></p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.</em></p>
<p>The strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.</p>
<p><em>Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).</em></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/b3477cab4c.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning"></p>
<p><em>On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):</em></p>

<p><strong>It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.</strong></p>

<p><strong>It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.</strong></p>

<h3 id="air-quality-monitoring">Air Quality Monitoring</h3>
<p>The strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/601d0ed36b.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO"></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/pm2.5_in_london_october19.pdf" title="PDF">background levels of PM2.5</a> in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO&rsquo;s target.</em></p>
<p>The draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.</p>
<p>Ealing has 67 air quality monitors acrosss the borough, all recording levels of notrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulater matter (PM10 only).</p>
<p><em>It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although their are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as <a href="https://www.airqualityengland.co.uk/local-authority/?la_id=191" title="Air Quality England: Southall monitors">The Green Quarter</a>.</em></p>
<p>Ealing publishes annual air quality <a href="https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/Reports.aspx">status reports</a>.</p>
<p><em>Ealing also has <a href="https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/DiffusionTubes.aspx">an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites</a> where you can see graphical annual data summary charts. Unfortunately, none seem to have been updated since 2021.</em></p>

<p><strong>It would be useful to have more monitors for particulate matter, especially PM2.5, across the borough, and in Southall, and for published data from all air pollution monitors to be kept accessible and up-to-date.</strong></p>

<h2 id="priorities-for-action">Priorities for Action</h2>
<p>Back to the strategy&rsquo;s priorities for action, and my <em>comments and questions</em>, and <strong>suggestions</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce road traffic emissions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The biggest reduction in road traffic emissions came during 2020 covid lockdowns, and while it&rsquo;s not practical, feasible or desirable to replicate that going forward, it might be worth promoting the idea that employers should encourage and support an increase to the 36% of Ealing&rsquo;s working age population already mainly <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/work/distance-travelled-to-work/workplace-travel-5a/works-mainly-from-home?lad=E09000009" title="2021 Census data on working from home in Ealing">working from home</a> whenever possible, as opposed to the current political groupthink that everyone must return to the office in order to be productive.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>There are two wood-burning incinerators close to my home, which frequently create disgusting burning plastic odours forcing us to stay indoors and close all our windows. Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council&rsquo;s response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn&rsquo;t give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Wouldn&rsquo;t this be fantastic?! Again, the Council&rsquo;s response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Invest in green infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Southall has the least <a href="https://www.ealingitree.online/stories/canopy-cover/0" title="Tree canopy cover in Ealing">tree canopy cover in Ealing</a>, yet is subjected to <a href="https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns" title="Over-development of Southall">massive overdevelopment</a>. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.</em></p>
<p><em>The one concession negotiated hard for by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the &lsquo;reset&rsquo; button. Having sat on the Mayor&rsquo;s money and done nothing for so long it&rsquo;s no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new &lsquo;pocket park&rsquo; outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-&lsquo;orchards&rsquo; planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the &lsquo;Poison Park&rsquo; to look forward to, the &lsquo;green space&rsquo; crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.</em></p>
<p><strong>If the council&rsquo;s air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.</strong></p>
<p><em>Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a &lsquo;compromise&rsquo; to <a href="https://ealing.news/environment/environmentalists-tell-ealing-council-and-its-leader-peter-mason-their-actions-will-result-in-ecocide-and-are-environmentally-reckless-and-ecologically-illiterate-over-warren-farm-sports-p" title="Ealing News coverage of Warren Farm story">destroy most of the already re-wilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall</a> in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don&rsquo;t want. I don&rsquo;t understand how the Leader&rsquo;s desires complement the Council&rsquo;s stated strategies to reduce air pollution, tackle the climate emergency they declared, and to protect and promote biodiversity and our ecosystem.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Raise awareness of air quality.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The council also wants to (and must) lead by example.</em></p>
<p><strong>If the council really wants to lead by example on reducing air pollution, then the council Leader cannot accept or request car rides to or from meetings in Southall, councillors cannot park in cycle lanes in Southall, nor fly to the property developer festival in the south of France. They must engage with Southall residents suffering the worst of the air pollution from multiple sources, and stop denying or minimising the existence and extent of the problems, and proactively and collaboratively work to reduce or stop such pollution episodes continuing.</strong></p>
<p><em>Otherwise, the council&rsquo;s strategy isn&rsquo;t worth the virtual paper it&rsquo;s printed on, and is just more hot air.</em></p>
<p><em>What we have in the draft plan, however, is largely a copy-and-paste of the previous 2017-2022 plan, which was, at worst, a demonstrable failure of ambition, leadership and political will, and, at best, a simple failure of the council to do what it said it would do.</em></p>

<h2 id="strategy-goals">Strategy Goals</h2>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Improve air quality. Protect the health and wellbeing of Ealing residents from the harmful effects
of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) air pollution.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The strategy MUST have the inclusive goal of protecting residents from the harmful effects of ALL air pollutants (not just nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter).</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Tackling the climate crisis&hellip;. by aiming for the highest environmental standards.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The &ldquo;highest environmental standards&rdquo; must be clearly stated and defined.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Fighting inequality&hellip;. to ensure that no-one is left behind&hellip; [and] residents feel safe.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The strategy must ensure that inequalities are reduced, that ALL residents are included in this process, and that their concerns for the safety of their air are taken seriously and acted upon.</strong> <em>Promoting the uptake of expensive electric vehicles and discounting parking spaces for them is discriminating against economically deprived mostly non-white people who suffer most from air pollution.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Protect biodiversity. Ensuring our parks, open spaces and nature are protected and enhanced.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This is particularly relevant right now, as the Council Leader pushes on with his undemocratic desire to destroy much of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall, and killing off a quarter of London&rsquo;s endangered skylarks, in order to build new sports pitches and/or a football stadium.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Protect health and wellbeing. Protecting and enhancing the physical and mental health of all.</li>

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Except in Southall? At every opportunity, Ealing Council has sought to erase, deny or minimise the the causes and impacts of air quality issues related to Southall Gasworks, refused to enforce any local solutions, and actively discouraged and attempted to prevent community activists' voices from being heard.</em></p>

Widening the bridge, as promised, would ease congestion, and improve air quality, public transport and active travel options.

<hr>
<h2 id="spotlight-on-southall">Spotlight on Southall</h2>
<p>These are all my comments, so I&rsquo;m not putting it all in <em>italics.</em></p>
<p>My suggestions and questions for the strategy are still in <strong>bold.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Southall cannot be used as a good example of how Ealing Council takes air pollution seriously.</strong></p>
<h3 id="inequalities-1">Inequalities</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/6a220c535f.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people"></p>
<p>Southall has a <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/identity/ethnic-group/ethnic-group-tb-20b/white-english-welsh-scottish-northern-irish-or-british?lad=E09000009" title="2021 Census data">BAME population of more than 90%</a>.</p>
<p>Southall Broadway/West and Southall Green are the two council wards that border the old Gasworks site, and which are downwind from the FM Conway asphalt and Tarmac plants, and the two wood-burning incinerators, depending on wind direction. They are connected by the Gasworks site and by the Air Quality Focus Area from South Road to The Green, King Street and Western Road.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/bbcfb05232.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites"></p>
<p>Southall is already a high pollution area (and an Air Quality Focus Area as a result), but has several additive sources of unmitigated, uncontrolled air pollution.</p>
<p>Economically poorer, BAME people, children, older people and pregnant women are the most vulnerable to the health impacts of toxic air pollution. Certainly not a fairer start for Southall’s children.</p>
<p>We know from bitter experience over the last six years in Southall that the council has failed in its duty to protect some of its most vulnerable residents from harm.</p>
<h3 id="raising-awareness">Raising Awareness</h3>
<p>To add insult to injury, the council failed to raise public awareness of the risks and the air quality monitoring data in an open and transparent manner before work on the site began, and while the work was in progress. It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”. Residents were never informed if, when or how levels of naphthalene were urgently reduced.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/16631f69b8.png" alt="Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council&rsquo;s statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment" title="Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment"></p>
<p>It’s noteworthy that the Council claims it asked PHE to get involved only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031045353/https://www.ealing.gov.uk/news/article/2035/statement_on_phe_southall_waterside_risk_assessment" title="Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment">“following concerns raised by local residents”</a> and not because the Council itself carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment prior to works starting in 2016, knowing that the Southall population was significantly more vulnerable to air pollution due to high pre-existing levels and multiple inequalities.</p>
<p>Similarly, the council says it responded to residents' concerns by installing &ldquo;independent&rdquo; air quality monitors on site in 2021, but this is five years after the work started, and two years after the main source of air pollution and odour complaints (the so-called soil &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;) was decommissioned. The monitors now installed record near-real time data for “urban background” emissions of odourless particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/e8d8fc3af0.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns"></p>
<p>The odours and air pollution that residents are concerned about originate from polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (i.e., the hundred years’ of toxic waste from town gas, coal tar and petrochemical work sites). We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!</p>
<h3 id="public-health">Public Health</h3>
<p>We are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. <strong>Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?</strong> The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?</p>
<p>Moreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years' of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. <strong>Why wasn&rsquo;t truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?</strong></p>
<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?</p>
<p>The council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks. Indeed half of the plan was missing from the planning portal and <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/845384/response/2020637/attach/html/5/FOI%20Response%2022%200363%20FINAL.pdf.html" title="Freedom of Information Response from Ealing Council stating they don't have a copy of the original CMP for Southall Gasworks">the council admitted that it didn&rsquo;t have a full copy of the original CMP</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How on earth was the council planning to enforce a CMP it wasn’t in possession of?</strong> This was a gross dereliction of duty to care for the health and wellbeing of (by its own definition) the most vulnerable residents in the borough.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/d485373622.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites" title="Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites"></p>
<p><strong>The Council was committed to full enclosure of waste sites in its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan. Why wasn’t the one hundred years of petrochemical waste &ldquo;soil cleaning hospital” enclosed?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.southallgasholders.com/" title="National Grid's website for the Southall Gasholders detailing their use of a soil cleaning enclosure">National Grid have enclosed their enclosed their soil remediation work</a> specifically to avoid causing odour nuisance to the local community (and thanks no doubt to campaigning by local residents and activists at Clean Air for Southall and Hayes).</p>
<h3 id="on-whose-side">On Whose Side?</h3>
<p>Why did the former and current council leader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181229123356/http://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Councillors/tabid/63/ctl/ViewCMIS_Person/mid/383/id/19/ScreenMode/Alphabetical/Default.aspx" title="Internet Archive page of former Ealing Council Leader Julian Bell's declarations of gifts and hospitality from developers">accept over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group</a> to fly (!) to the south of France for what Private Eye Magazine describes as <a href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/dispatches-from-cannes-46501" title="Inside Housing article on the MIPIM property festival and Private Eye Magazine's description of it as a booze and hookerfest">a booze and hookerfest</a>?</p>
<p>The new council leader claims he went there to negotiate hard. If that&rsquo;s the case, what did he negotiate? He also claimed that it wasn&rsquo;t what he expected and that it was a mistake to go. If that&rsquo;s also the case, <a href="https://ealing.nub.news/news/local-news/former-ealing-council-housing-leader-admits-he-39made-a-mistake39-accepting-3000-from-developer-for-cannes-property-conference" title="Ealing Nub news article on current Ealing Council Leader Peter Mason's admission that accepting developers' gifts and hospitality was a mistake">why was it a mistake</a>?</p>
<p><strong>How can we be sure that the new council leader and his administration won&rsquo;t continue making these mistakes and taking the side of developers rather than standing up for the residents they are elected to represent?</strong></p>
<h3 id="local--action">Local  Action</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/c66801e7f1.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response"></p>
<p><strong>If the soil is now clean and the air is safe to breathe, why would stopping works during hot weather (which didn’t happen in 2018), and covering stockpiles (why weren’t they covered already?) be given as examples of possible mitigating actions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>There must be a new commitment to work with and for residents where these are issues. Air pollution and odour nuisance reporting and investigation procedures need to be overhauled as they are currently not fit for purpose (reporting process too convoluted, each one investigated as a single, isolated incident rather than as part of an ongoing problem, residents are simply not believed and our reports are minimised and invalidated).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Work on the Gasworks site is due to complete in 2038. Why is the date for net-zero emissions set for twelve years after this date in 2050?</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a similar commitment to target zero-emissions for construction vehicles by 2040, which is two years after the new draft local Plan period for new developments ends.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/c4e6ee2c8e.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers"></p>
<p><strong>What has Ealing Council done to date to campaign for greater regulatory powers and for a Clean Air Act? Please give examples.</strong></p>
<p>This draft Air Quality Strategy is fine in many respects in terms of the words it contains, but what concerns me is that these are empty words if they are not acted on and enforced.</p>
<p>Recent history strongly suggests the council doesn&rsquo;t have the leadership, organisational culture or political will to act in the interests of its most vulnerable residents in Southall.</p>
<h3 id="active-travel">Active Travel</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about active travel and Ealing Council&rsquo;s multi-million pound Let&rsquo;s Go Southall campaign in the draft Strategy, but <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/825485/response/1997481/attach/html/5/FOI%20Response%2022%200079%20FINAL.pdf.html" title="Let's Go Southall Freedom of Information Request">very little on its real cost and impact</a>. They seem to have about 50 regular weekly activity groups. Over two years that&rsquo;s 5,000 sessions. 30,000 attendances (not individuals). So average of six people per session? 1,000 people attended at least two sessions (repeat attendances). My guess would be not many more than 1,000 in total, most will be repeaters (thinking GP referrals, lots of organisers?). If it&rsquo;s helped 1,000 individuals, that&rsquo;s £5,400 per person. If 10,000 it&rsquo;s £540 per person (still seems like a lot of money). And there&rsquo;s no evidence that it&rsquo;s helped anyone!</p>
<p><strong>The council must be open and transparent with residents that Let&rsquo;s Go Southall is a top-down neoliberal behavioural change (&ldquo;nudge theory&rdquo;) programme led by a retired stockbroker, and not the &ldquo;grassroots social movement&rdquo; of the council&rsquo;s Orwellian publicity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the Council is serious about improving safe active travel options in Southall, then it must improve road and pavement conditions and safety first. Many of the roads and pavements are not fit to cycle or walk on, especially for children and families, older people, and people with disabilities.</strong></p>

<h1 id="air-quality-action-plan">Air Quality Action Plan</h1>
<h2 id="the-2017-2022-action-plan">The 2017-2022 Action Plan</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/da4994ee82.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution" title="Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution"></p>
<p>a. Included a number of no-or-low-impact schemes such as Low Emission Neighbourhoods (LENs), implemented in 2021 as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. <strong>Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?</strong></p>

<p>b. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. <strong>Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.</strong></p>
<p>c. Another low impact scheme was Play Streets. <strong>How many Play Streets are there now? How often do they run? Where are they?</strong></p>
<p>d. <strong>How many Pocket Parks are there? Where are they?</strong></p>
<p>e. <strong>How many Green Screens  are there? Where are they? Why were green screens not erected at Southall Gasworks even after residents complained of dust from the site in their homes?</strong></p>
<p>f. <strong>How are these schemes evaluated in terms of reducing air pollution? Where are the air quality monitors located to record baseline measurements to compare against air pollution levels during or after the scheme is in place?</strong></p>
<p>g. <strong>Enforcement of anti-idling laws was deemed &ldquo;not cost-effective&rdquo;. Smoke control was not deemed a problem and therefore not promoted or enforced. Who made these decisions?</strong></p>
<p>h. <strong>What is the wider &lsquo;cost&rsquo; to residents in not taking enforcement action against these criminal behaviours?</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/a6a7ae4c4e.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone"></p>
<p><strong>If air pollution monitoring data cannot inform the efficacy of individual actions, how can it be used in combination with secondary data to do so?</strong> I&rsquo;m sure there must be a sensible explanation, but to most people I suspect this statement makes little sense. In Southall, we have continuously been asked to ignore our own lived experience of health and quality of life problems attributed to the open-air &lsquo;cleaning&rsquo; of a hundred years of petrochemical waste at the Gasworks site, in favour of the developer Berkeley&rsquo;s assurances that it&rsquo;s own monitoring of air quality is &lsquo;within acceptable limits&rsquo; and harmless to health. Public Health England published four risk assessments based on Berkeley&rsquo;s data, and came to similar conclusions, although neither looked at any secondary data. The air pollution data has still to be published so that the public can make up their own minds.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/8b107c503e.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/4cd9b2f1fa.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how imperceptible changes that cannot be detected by monitoring or modelling can be interpreted as Low Impact or a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>The Action Plan here seems to contradict the Strategy by stating that changes in the levels of air pollution above a certain level can be attributed even to individual actions (although more likely to be due to multiple actions).</p>
<p><strong>If the council is serious about using air pollution data and secondary data to establish efficacy of its air quality strategy and action plan, (which sounds sensible enough), then it must explain what measures it will use, and publish baseline data and regular updates.</strong></p>
<p>Like it does with its <a href="https://ealingperformance.inphase.com/Plan/856" title="Ealing Council Performance Dashboard">performance dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the Council&rsquo;s own evaluation of it&rsquo;s 2017-22 Action Plan, I would suggest that it&rsquo;s achievements are minimal, and misleading.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/2af9af507b.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan"></p>
<p>Electric Vehicle charging points (p. 30 of 2022 AQAP) were not actually a specified target in the 2017 AQAP, so I&rsquo;m unsure how this can be claimed as an achievement? Similarly with School Streets and specific cycle lanes. LENS/LTNs were specified as a target, but there is no mention of that fiasco here. <strong>Air quality monitoring data must be used to locate pollution hotspots for any future implementation of LENs/LTNs</strong></p>
<p>The 20 mph speed limit was implemented borough-wide, but only since December 2021. Why did it take so long? What is the use of it if it isn’t enforced, especially in Southall?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There will be 14,800 new homes in 23 new developments in Southall over the next few years. 14 units over 10 stories high, and 7 over 20 stories high. Up to 40,000 new residents (and their cars)!</p>
<p>One third of the total new developments in the whole of Ealing borough (only Acton is getting it worse).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So not happening so much in the &lsquo;white&rsquo; or richer areas of the borough, for some reason.</p>
<p>None of these homes will be genuinely affordable to most people currently living in overcrowded homes in Southall or Ealing, as Studio bedsit flats start at around £300,000!</p>
<p>Most will stay empty until they are sold to investors from China, Malaysia, Singapore, Bahrain(!) where they are actively marketed by the greedy property developers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The same property developers who gave former Ealing Council &lsquo;Leader&rsquo; Julian Bell and new Ealing Council &lsquo;Leader&rsquo; Peter Mason (also a Southall Green ward councillor) over £30,000 in recent years to holiday in the south of France at the MIPIM property festival in Cannes described as a &ldquo;booze &lsquo;n&rsquo; hookerfest&rdquo; by Private Eye Magazine.</p>
<p>Bell says, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t cost the taxpayer a penny&rdquo;, but in Southall we are already paying with our health and quality of life thanks to the poisonous air from the development of the contaminated old gasworks site (due to complete in 2038!).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Town planner Mason says it was a mistake, and not what he expected(!).</p>
<p>Where will 40,000 new residents' children go to school (and how will they get there and back), how will they get an appointment to see a GP, which hospital will they go to when they need emergency treatment, and how will they get there on the roads already regularly gridlocked by too much traffic?</p>
<p>Worth taking the time to have a look at <a href="https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns.">stopthetowers.info/other-cam&hellip;</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Cllr Mason recommended we read Bob Colenutt&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Property Lobby: The Hidden Reality Behind the Housing Crisis&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>What Colenutt says (and he has a wealth of experience in local authority housing and planning, and in the community resisting property developers), is that developers do have too much power (as Mason argues), but also that local councils and councillors do not do enough to resist, do not have the negotiating skills (contrary to how Mason originally described the importance of trips to MIPIM to &lsquo;negotiate hard&rsquo;), and too readily embrace the &lsquo;financialisation&rsquo; of the land and property market brought about by David Cameron&rsquo;s and Nick Clegg&rsquo;s ConDem government in 2010.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So now, we have a very real housing crisis fuelling the huge profits of private developers, all facilitated and egged on by mostly Labour councils too easily rolling over and allowing them to build fewer and fewer &lsquo;genuinely affordable homes&rsquo; (because &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the profit in that?&quot;).</p>
<p>What Colenutt says loudly and clearly is that without ordinary people&rsquo;s and communities' resistance it would be so much worse, and that to all intents and purposes councils and councillors are in bed with the developers.</p>

<p>Body:</p>
<p>On 13 December Zarah Sultana MP  is presenting the #FreeSchoolMealsForAll Bill in Parliament.</p>
<p>The bill would extend Free School Meals to every child in primary school. It would support families and help ensure every child has the basics to grow and thrive.</p>
<p>MPs should back families, back children, and back the bill.</p>
<p>I’ve just asked my MP to back the Bill. Can you ask your MP to do the same?</p>

			 <p>A little under three years ago I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eulogised about Jimmy Carter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the footballer, not the peanut farmer) in a musical response to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->20lb Sounds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> eulogising about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jimmy Carter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the peanut farmer, not the footballer).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wondered why Dan, the band’s Liverpool-supporting singer-songwriter, had neglected the opportunity to write about a player who is widely acknowledged (from a cursory search of fan forums) as one of Liverpool’s worst ever signings?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two years later (thanks to the wonder of the internet, and possibly also the wonder of Doug Whitfield and his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Music Manumit Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), I received a reply:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Around this time, I also received another reply:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->(For those of you of a technical and/or inquisitive nature, I’ve posted screenshots of these comments because I lost the ability to link to them as actual comments on the original blog post during one of my many blog migrations.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, I don’t know if this is the real Dan Lynch or if it is Doug Whitfield pretending to be Dan to somehow boost his podcast ratings, but who cares?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tracked Jimmy down and found a recent interview with him on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Millwallant podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in which Jimmy ‘tells us what it’s like to be a professional footballer and also demonstrates his genuine knowledge and passion for the game.’ I found it really quite insightful, all the more so coming from a player who most people have forgotten, never heard of, or so easily disparage based on his ‘failures’ at Liverpool and Arsenal.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you prefer to read, there’s a similar interview <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on the Arsenal website<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What got me obsessing about a fairly obscure ex-Millwall, Liverpool, Arsenal and Portsmouth footballer again? Well, Dan’s band 20lb Sounds <!-- raw HTML omitted -->took five quid off me<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in time for Xmas 2012 on the promise of an album release in February 2013. Since then there have been a few updates about how the album would be ready ‘next month’, ‘in time for Xmas’ and how much Dan and the boys were enjoying their holidays in the sun. But no album. Until now. A year later. But only for backers, for the time being (see footnote 1). I had a listen this morning, and, really, it sounds great. Well done, to all concerned.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I decided to have another go at my own take on 20lb Sounds’ Jimmy Carter. I could have teased and tormented you all by not releasing it for another two years, and only to people who had given me money to do so, but I’m not like that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, without further ado, and introducing MC Jimmy ‘The Cartz’ Carter rapping an intro (footnote 2), and Richard ‘Smash it!’ Keys rapping the chorus-to-verse bridges (footnote 3) as part of his rehabilitation and bid to replace Richard Scudamore as chief executive of the Premier League, here’s my new, updated easy listening version of Jimmy Carter:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The new 20lb Sounds album<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is now available to all!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jimmy Carter rap intro lifted from the Millwallant podcast interview somewhere around the 49 minute mark.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Richard Keys, for it is he, smashed and grabbed from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Millwall 2-0 Sheffield Wednesday, (old) Division One, 23-9-1989<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Six years ago <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wondered<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if the lack of Englishmen in Arsenal’s team (and most of the other leading Premier League teams) would herald a new era of Scotland-like failure for the England football team? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, thanks in part to Arsene Wenger’s penchant for Saintly youth team players (Theo, The Ox), we’re not quite there, yet, although undercover Scotsman Steve McClaren successfully tried and failed to qualify for Euro 2008.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mediocre<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But perhaps that also explains why there are now six players (Kelly, Johnson, Henderson, Downing, Carroll - and it’s debatable whether any of them would get into the current Scotland team - plus captain Gerrard) from a mid-table, mediocre Liverpool squad in the current England set-up?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Five years ago I blogged about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the problem with English football<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - how our ‘long history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world’ perversely raises mainstream media expectations for the national side upon the start of any tournament for which we qualify. (Of course, I realise that they can hardly expect to win the ratings war and/or advertising revenue by informing potential viewers that it’s not likely to be New Improved England, but more Same Old England, if we’re lucky. Especially not when we need all the distraction we can get from the grim reality of how useless and fucked up our country is right now.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Failures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Had Gareth Barry not picked up an injury and had to withdraw from the current squad, England would almost certainly be starting Euro 2012 against France with the same successful central midfield system that ‘Jocky’ McClaren stumbled upon - Gerrard and Barry - just prior to his tactically innovative use of an umbrella as cover in the pissing rain and then being sacked and publicly humiliated for his efforts (which, statistically, were on a par with Sir Bobby Robson’s, and mirrored Sir Alf Ramsey’s and Robson’s failures to qualify for their first tournaments in charge). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two years ago I successfully predicted (admittedly, not hard to do) that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->England didn’t have a hope in hell of winning the World Cup in South Africa<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The good news this time around is that Joe Hart is in goal and that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‘lumbering hulk of long-ball fodder who couldn’t score a goal even if you put it in front of him and offered him £50,000 a week’<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, also known as Emile Heskey, is not even on the standby list (although Andy Carroll does look like a handy replacement).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Left at home<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bad news is that the only English defender we have who has actually proved himself in tournament football, Rio Ferdinand, has been left at home by Old Mother Hodgson because he is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scorpio<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our defence, therefore, is likely to be the same as that which kept out the mighty Algeria, and the smallest nation at the finals two years ago, Slovenia, but with Phil Jagielka or Joleon Lescott replacing former England captain Ferdinand (who of course, was himself replaced before the tournament began due to injury by the injury-prone Ledley King, who of course, was himself replaced due to injury in the first game by Jamie Carragher, who of course, was himself replaced in the third game due to being crap by, er, Stoke bench-warmer Matthew Upson) alongside racist philanderer, and former England captain (twice over) John Terry.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As good a defence, in effect, as that which went on to concede four goals to a proper team, Germany.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Failures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moving on to the midfield (if we can keep possession of the football for long enough) it looks like England will be starting with the same creative talents as in South Africa, bar the injured Barry and Lampard, who will be replaced by the injured Parker and Gerrard. Milner or Walcott (for footballing reasons, presumably) are likely to come in for Aaron Lennon on the right, with Stewart Downing (for footballing reasons… oh, wait) taking over from Milner/Gerrard on the left. Despite my longing for Downing to score the winning goal in a penalty shoot-out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the final against the Germans<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this midfield quartet cannot in any way be described as an improvement on 2010’s fiasco, or even 2008’s failures.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up front, of course, England will have to play proper teams France and Sweden without Wayne Rooney, our one truly world class player. By the time he’s eligible to play in England’s final group game against the co-hosts Ukraine, England are quite likely to be needing a win to have any hope of even qualifying for the quarter-finals.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thoroughly outplayed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->England’s two warm-up games have followed a similar pattern to those in 2010, although perhaps offering a glimmer of hope where two years ago there really was none. In 2010, England were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‘thoroughly outplayed at Wembley by Mexico, only winning by virtue of having taller players, and then, in Austria, thoroughly outplayed by the equally diminutive Japan, only winning by virtue of two fortuitous own goals’<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In 2012, England were thoroughly outplayed in Norway, only winning by virtue of a sublime piece of skill from Ashley Young, and then, at Wembley, thoroughly outplayed by Belgium, only winning by virtue of a sublime piece of skill from Danny Welbeck.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Humiliation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspect that England’s tournament will pan out in equally inglorious fashion, beginning with defeat at the feet of the French, put to the sword in a dire draw by the Swedes, and ignominious exit in the rain against Ukraine. To cope with the likely onset of boredom, depression and homicidal rage, I recommend following the same principles as in my guide to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The World Cup on drugs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if England’s special brand of austerity football means avoiding the pain of humiliation against Spain in the quarter-finals, then it’s surely all for the greater good.</p>

			 <p>A long time ago, back in January 2010 in fact, Dan Lynch’s band 20lb Sounds released their song Jimmy Carter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->20lb Sounds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) / <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CC BY-SA 3.0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is our first original release. It’s called Jimmy Carter and as you might expect it’s about… well… Jimmy Carter, the former US president. We didn’t set out to write a song about him particularly, it’s just that someone came out with the line “Jimmy Carter was a peanut farmer”, and it had to be put into song. After a quick trawl of his Wikipedia page we were turning up all sorts of gems.

Mad huh?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All those nuggets of trivia found their way into the lyrics. It was originally just the main riff but then other sections were written to make it a bit more interesting as a full song.

			 <p>If England’s game against Algeria had been a Wimbledon tennis match, the two sides would still be at it today with the Dutch Master Johan Cruyff declaring it the greatest example of Total Crap Football ever played.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Both sets of players would be awarded (honorary) knighthoods for their part in simulating Barnsley versus Grimsby Town at a freezing cold Oakwell on New Year’s Day in the late 1990s/early 2000s and no doubt the two managers would be encased in marble as a living testament to their obduracy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if the first round of group games were like pure-grade heroin cut with shavings of Clive Tyldesley and smuggled past England’s Robert Green at UK border control, I have to admit that I overdosed, taking up to six hours a day for more than a week.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After an early rush of excitement, I fell into a deep reverie induced by triple daily doses of drab defensive displays before finally lapsing into a tactical coma, waking up just in time for this Sunday’s World Cup Final showdown between England and Germany.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Having beaten the USA in the knockout stages, Fabio Capello must be delighted that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his masterplan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has come to fruition and England are within 90 minutes of lifting the Jules Rimet trophy once more.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A valiant effort, all the more remarkable as we have scored only two goals in the process of knocking out the most powerful nation on earth (truly, an us against US game if ever there was one), the tricky North Africans and then the smallest footballing nation at the Finals, Slovenia.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I take my hat off to Fabio and his men and will go on to eat it for dinner, too, as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was convinced we really didn’t have a hope in hell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of seeing this dream come true.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a tribute, I offer my exclusive guide to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The World Cup On Drugs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for your viewing enhancement:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alcohol<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Preferably beer and lots of it.

Can really make you feel good for 90 minutes, but then you can start to get heavy-legged and risk missing vital goals while you go for a pee. Can also leave you feeling tired and miserable for days afterwards if you’re over 40.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Undoubtedly the football fan’s favourite tipple, alcohol can make even France versus Uruguay seem like the most compelling game of end-to-end football you’ve ever seen. OK, maybe not even alcohol can do that. Which is why you might consider some slightly more risqué alternatives.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cannabis and marijuana<!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you smoke or otherwise consume enough of this, you won’t care who wins as long as you have plenty of chocolate and crisps. Not a good idea to try ordering a Chinese takeaway while watching either of the two Korean sides, either, unless you want bean curd noodles with prawn cracker soup and a meat cleaver in your head for being a cheeky bastard.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may find yourself laughing uncontrollably at the little Mexican and Japanese players (but see LSD, below) and at some of the many comedy commentating double-entendres and other funnies such as:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bougherra goes in hard on Butt!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->He’s got Eggiman on the face, there.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Messi leaves Shittu trailing in his wake.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pantsil’s off!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bong.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amphetamines, ecstacy and cocaine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In theory, you might think any of these stimulants would be great for staying alert during the opening round of games, but as your brain processes information faster so these interminable games begin to last forever and - as we all know - you risk irreversible catatonia.

			 <p>Fabio Capello’s master plan to take England to the World Cup final is finally taking shape.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the evidence seen so far, truly it is something of a fantasy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sorry bunch of posers (Wayne Rooney, our only hope and Sid Vicious-like talisman ready to self-destruct at any moment, excepted) that represent our once proud nation may fail even to qualify for the ‘<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It’s A Knockout<!-- raw HTML omitted -->’ stages let alone reach the final for what would be our finest hour-and-half (plus extra-time and penalties, if needed) for 44 years.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If by some bloody miracle we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reach the final, I just hope we don’t live to regret not thinking about a master plan to actually win it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But our preparations - highlights of which include being thoroughly outplayed at Wembley by Mexico and only winning by virtue of having taller players and then today in Austria being thoroughly outplayed by the equally diminutive Japan and only winning by virtue of two fortuitous own goals - are now over.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even if he won’t be singing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->God Save The Queen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, at least Capello now knows who his 23 will be. Here, I can exclusively reveal who they will be and why.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In goal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In reverse order, building from the back as all England teams do, Capello already knew who his three goalkeepers would be.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->David James, who has made something of a career littered with often hilarious yet calamitous mistakes (which must give hope for the future to Ben Foster), was first choice until his injury at Portsmouth allowed Rob Green, who seems to be compiling his own personal back catalogue of often hilarious yet calamitous mistakes, to take over.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ironically, the best of the lot could be the young but inexperienced third choice Joe Hart.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While I think Capello must have been tempted by James’s much greater experience, I think he will stick with Rob Green to start knowing that he has capable back up if needed due to loss of form, injury or suspension.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Robert GREEN<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the back<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lazily rolling the ball out to the defence, Capello knows his preferred back four of Glen Johnson, captain Rio Ferdinand, John Terry and Ashley Cole, the two Chelsea players competing for the role of Johnny Rotten.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The question is, how does he balance the ideal of having like-for-like back up while making sure he has enough options to cover for lack of form and fitness after injury?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That will depend to some extent on Gareth Barry’s injury as he would be the natural choice to cover for Ashley Cole and a better option, if fit, than the specialist left back Leighton Baines, who has looked out of his depth at this level.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2 Glen JOHNSON 3 Ashley COLE 4 Gareth BARRY 5 Rio FERDINAND 6 John TERRY<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the middle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Calmly passing the ball out to the midfield, again Capello knows his first choice is for Frank Lampard to partner Gareth Barry in the middle, with Steven Gerrard and Theo Walcott out wide.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->With Barry’s injury it’s likely that Gerrard will be asked to fill in centrally in preference to an out-of-sorts Michael Carrick or the impressive but still inexperienced James Milner, who will be trusted to take Gerrard’s starting place on the left in England’s first game against the USA.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 Theo WALCOTT 8 Frank LAMPARD<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up front<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Desperately hoofing the ball up to the forwards now and giving the ball away, bizarrely we once again have the lovely Emile Heskey as our first choice centre forward.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It’s like being back in 2002 all over again, except that back then Heskey was just a lumbering hulk of long-ball fodder who couldn’t score a goal even if you put it in front of him and offered him £50,000 a week.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heskey’s England career, like Gareth Barry’s of course, was reconstructed by former England manager and still object of derision (mostly for being so wet, despite sensibly opting for an umbrella to keep the rain off while his England team failed not to lose their must-not-lose game against Croatia) Steve McClaren.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even so, Heskey is believed to be Rooney’s preferred strike partner, presumably because he makes him look even better.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->9 Emile HESKEY 10 Wayne ROONEY 11 Steven GERRARD<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Left back at home<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think Capello must have been tempted to take only three specialist, but versatile central defenders as cover - King (who can also play a holding role in midfield), Jamie Carragher (who can cover both full-back roles as just as badly as centre back) and Matt Upson (who could conceivably cover at left-back if needed).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The advantage of taking Baines as well is that even if we had three players out with injury or suspension we would still have a defender on the bench.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But Capello must surely think that better options, in the unlikely event they are even needed, are the versatility of Michael Carrick, who has played a central defensive role a couple of times for United and James Milner, who can fill in on either flank as a full-back. Christ, I’d rather have Gerrard and Rooney at full back than Baines.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stephen Warnock and Michael Dawson are untested alternatives, and I don’t see the point of Leighton Baines, so I don’t see how Capello can either.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 David JAMES 13 Jamie CARRAGHER 14 Ledley KING 15 Matt UPSON<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Passed out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other benefit of not taking Leighton Baines is that it frees up a place for a more attack-minded player.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While Capello has a had a good look at Tom Huddlestone, who has played well for Spurs this season, I think he will miss out along with Scott Parker who was the injury reserve, and stick with the experience of Michael Carrick, despite his fairly miserable recent run of form.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aaron Lennon is the preferred like-for-like replacement for Walcott.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->16 Aaron LENNON 17 Michael CARRICK 18 James MILNER<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bent over<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Peter Crouch and Jermain Defoe were always certainties to go and Darren Bent never really had a chance.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->19 Peter CROUCH 20 Jermain DEFOE<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tossed off<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe Cole, who must think he looks more and more like a fat Joe Cole with every pie he eats, offers experienced and creative cover in any attacking midfield role.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That leaves exciting new boy Adam Johnson fighting for a place with his little big-club team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips, who, like Glenn Matlock, can feel a little hard done by.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just like at City, expect Johnson, who can genuinely play on either wing, to get the nod in the potential-matchwinner-who-won’t-even-get-on role.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->21 Joe COLE 22 Adam JOHNSON 23 Joe HART<!-- raw HTML omitted -->So there you have it, to put you out of your misery two days early.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank me in the comments.</p>

			 <p>The only United match I’ve been to in recent years was last season’s FA Cup tie at home to Spurs, courtesy of E.on’s sponsorship and their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Family Football<!-- raw HTML omitted --> initiative. I went with a couple of my ‘clients’ from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->work<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, had a great road trip and fantastic all-round experience. One’s a Spurs fan, and I know he felt a mixture of joy and anxiety sat in amongst all the United fans (even in the Family stand) when Spurs went 1-0 up. But both were amazed by the genuine friendliness and good-natured humour of the locals as we mingled around outside the stadium before kick-off. I’m pleased to say that both are working or about to start work now. I really believe that going to this match (and we also went to Wembley and White Hart Lane) helped to put a bit of the spark back into their lives, to begin to believe and to hope again. The Theatre of Dreams, indeed!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I went to a few games in the ’90s when I was working in Manchester, mostly European nights, which then weren’t that well supported. I remember seeing David Beckham play one of his first games and you could see right away that he was a special talent. Before that, I saw Roy Keane when he was still at Forest. I think he scored a hat-trick at Bolton (where I was studying) and he was another one that you could see was on another level, right away. My favourite game in the 90’s, though, has to be Sheffield United away in a midweek game. We won 3-0, fabulous counter-attacking stuff and fantastic goals from Cantona, Hughes and Sharpe!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back to the late 70’s again, my dad took me to see United get walloped 4-0 at OT by Cloughie’s Forest and I saw the 3-5 thrashing we received at the hands of West Brom, not to mention the 0-0 versus Wolves with George Berry. We were frigging crap a lot of the time, occasionally brilliant, but never consistently good enough.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have a lot to thank my dad for. Thanks, Dad! He got me a Subbuteo set one Xmas and meticulously painted on the United colours, numbers and even facial hair of the players. I was gutted when my ickle Lou Macari broke both legs and he was never the same player again despite being able to return for the next match thanks to a tube of superglue!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The best thing about all of this, though, is being able to immediately rebut all the ABUs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who, when I tell them who I support, start their tired old accusations of glory-hunting, London Reds, etc. I started watching United when they were at their lowest ebb (in terms of league status) since they became popular worldwide. I’ve personally endured almost twenty of the “years of hurt” growing up watching those other reds (funny how so many of the kids I went to school with in Lincolnshire were Liverpool fans) win year after year with just a few crumbs of comfort coming our way in the FA Cup. Both my mum and dad were and still are ardent United supporters and if it wasn’t for them I’d probably be a Mariner or worse!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, thanks, mum and dad, for uniting and ensuring that I was born in Stretford General!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fans of ‘Anyone but United’. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->↩<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>It’s often the case that what in one sense is an undeniable strength can at the same time also be a real or potential weakness. English football’s great history and tradition raises everyone’s expectations, yet the English football team must compete on an increasingly commercialised and sophisticated international playing field. We have more fans, more money and more foreigners in our game than any other country, so it’s no surprise that when things don’t go to plan, everyone feels quite upset and let down. And the media does its best to blame anyone and everyone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There’s such a lot at stake, now. It was only sixty years or so ago that the Football Association, which is now grieving over the financial loss of failure to qualify for Euro 2008 and stating that qualification for Euro and World Cup Finals is a minimum requirement of the team manager/coach, actively prevented the national team from taking part. It’s only forty years or so since we won it. As it happens, Sir Alf Ramsey, like Second Choice Steve McClaren also failed to qualify for his first Euro Finals in 1964…. We have a long history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world, so it’s not as if it’s anything new or that we should be surprised about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with English football has been documented in the press as being anything from too many foreign players, too much money, expectation of fans not matched with reality, players and coaches not good enough, not enough passion or care, too much passion and not enough technique, too much pressure and fear, too much drinking and not enough team spirit. The reality is probably that all of these factors are important to a lesser or greater degree. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too many foreign players<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Sven-Goran Erikkson points out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, managers often buy overseas players because they are cheaper on average than their English or British counterparts. That’s also why so few of our players play abroad - because there isn’t the money to pay them, not necessarily that they aren’t good enough. Beckham was and arguably still is good enough to play for Real Madrid. That’s why there are too many foreign players.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much money<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So part of the problem may be that the players get paid too much? But that is not the players’ fault, just market forces, mainly to do with Sky TV money and, er, the FA, who contract with them for Premier League (the same FA which hijacked the Football League) and England rights. What this means is that the very best English players - who are on a par at least, with the very best players in the world - are paid significantly more. This is why Arsene Wenger has so few English players in his squad, not because they aren’t good enough, but because they are too expensive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The new Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe I’m wrong, but it seems to me that we are repeating what happened in Scotland during the Graeme Souness era at Rangers - he bought lots of foreigners in, Celtic and others later followed suit and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Scottish national team suffered as a result<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’m not the only one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who thinks that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->England are the new Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The recent Scottish revival has surely been due to Rangers and Celtic developing a core group of home-grown players to complement their foreign signings. And I’m sure that a lot of their England based players can’t wait to get a game for Scotland after watching too many games from the stand or playing for less successful clubs!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overpaid English players<!-- raw HTML omitted -->At club level, Arsenal are successful in part at least because they have a salary structure which prevents them buying overpaid English players, but keeps team spirit up - see how much better they are doing without the overpaid Henry! Same with United to a different extent. Fergie’s discipline is what he buys by paying top wages and Ince, Kanchelskis, Beckham, Van Nistelrooy and Keane are all examples of players who reached their sell-by dates, for the team’s eventual benefit. Chelsea pay everyone top wages, of course, while my guess is that the likes of Liverpool, Newcastle, Spurs and any other under-achievers get the balance wrong between wages and value.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much pressure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there’s more to it than that. Michael Owen says that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the players can’t cope with the pressure of playing for England now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not that they don’t care. Although at some point we have to admit that other teams are sometimes better than us, that would certainly explain some lacklustre performances and results. Where does the pressure come from? The fans? The media?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My opinion is that the fans want England to win, or - if they can’t win - to play well, trying. The media just want to sell stories, and their marketing strategy is the time-honoured sensationalism of even the most mundane non-news (Steve McClaren under an umbrella. OK, so he looked a bit daft, but, if he kept dry and we’d won…). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we lost to Croatia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What we should all have been saying was congratulations to Croatia on a deserved victory and let’s support McClaren in  rebuilding for real this time instead of picking on every little thing and waiting for him to fail. Things looked good against Russia and Israel, he stumbled across a “system” (Gerrard and Barry) that worked. He was unlucky with injuries, but should have been given longer.</p>

			 <p>United’s FA Cup tie with Wolves last weekend and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Auntie’s ‘flashback’<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Rio Ferdinand?), reminded me to finally get around to posting a few of my own memories, originally prompted by George Best’s sad demise in November.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->George had quit United long before I can first remember watching them. But Best remained an important part of my United life - the school chant was “Georgie Best, Superstar, He walks like a woman and he wears a bra!” - and Dad would always remind me that whatever “my” United did they were never as good as Best, Law an Charlton and the rest of Busby’s Babes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can see what he meant, now! And he did concede that watching Cantona, Kanchelskis and Giggs at their peak was probably just as exciting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, 1974-5 season was my first, when United were in the old League Division Two. I didn’t understand the significance of the different divisions then, just enjoyed the BBC’s and Yorkshire TV’s occasional match coverage when we took on the regional challengers of the time - the big guns of York City, Rotherham United, Hull City and Sheffield Wednesday, if my memory serves me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That year we won the D2 title and returned to the top division.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We then got to three out of the next four Cup Finals (when that meant something), winning just once (but against Treble-chasing Liverpool).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six years after we had won the European Cup with Best, Law, Charlton and the rest we had teams comprising (as I remember them):<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Alex Stepney, then Paddy Roche, then Gary Bailey <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2 Alex Forsyth, then Jimmy Nichol <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 Stuart Houston, then Arthur Albiston (who popped up on Five Live recently) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 Gerry Daly, then Brian Greenhof, then Sammy McIlroy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 Brian Greenhoff, then Gordon McQueen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 Martin Buchan (c) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 Steve Coppell <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8 Sammy McIlroy, then Jimmy Greenhoff <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9 Stuart Pearson, then Joe Jordan <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 Lou Macari <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11 Gordon Hill, then Mickey Thomas <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 David McCreery, then Ashley Grimes<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stepney was a legend, the last of Sir Matt’s European Champions. Bailey was talented - I remember a couple of full-stretch diving saves he made in the 5-3 home defeat by West Brom….Houston was the first person I’d ever heard tell someone else to fuck off. That he did it in response to baiting from a total stranger on the terraces was even more startling to me then.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ever since I always had a sense that Houston was quite evil. I’m sure he isn’t! It reminds me, too, of the televised live England game when Ray Wilkins told the (Uruguyan?) ball boy to “give me the fucking ball”. Not to mention when Eric jumped into the crowd feet first!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->McIlroy was ‘the last of the Busby Babes’ (probably also ‘the new George Best’), but never quite managed to live up to it, despite being a great servant to the club. I was really sad when he had to leave not long after Bryan Robson and Remi Moses arrived a few years later. Not long before he moved on he scored a fantastic solo goal against Wolves.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Buchan was the ever-dependable rock and heartbeat of the team. Scored a couple of last minute<!-- raw HTML omitted -->equalisers, drives from outside the penalty area, one at home to Everton?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Coppell had an economics degree apparently. Probably would make a good manager one day…. Career cut short by injury.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pearson was an up-and-at-them, no fear, old-fashioned centre forward, replaced by Joe Jordan, an up-and-at-them, no fear, old-fashioned centre forward with no front teeth. Wonderful!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Macari was the mischief-maker-in-chief, apparently ran a chip shop outside the ground and provided the role model for free-scoring (Celtic) strikers to sign for United, dry up and move back into midfield….<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gordon Hill’s demise was a source of childhood grief for me, which even now I find difficult to understand. Lee Sharpe followed suit more recently. Thomas was a cheeky-chappy, work-hard, play-hard type with silly hair.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->McCreery was our not-so-supersub and Grimes was never a United player, surely?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Which brings me back to the current team/squad. Who are the Ashley Grimeses of today? Van der Sar looks a bit like Paddy Roche, but so did Roy Carroll. We need a world class keeper, still.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gary Neville will be looking forward to the Liverpool rematch in the Cup, no doubt!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wes Brown might still come through as genuine class, but realistically he’s always going to be a squaddie. Same applies to Mikael Silvestre. Gabriel Heinze has been missed and I expect he will partner Rio in central defence next season, that’s if Patrice Evra comes through at left back.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then there’s Vidic, O’Shea, Richardson, Bardsley….<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who will replace Roy Keane? That’s probably the wrong question. Football’s a team game and the best teams don’t rely on one player, but on individuals gelling as units within the team. United at their best could win without Keane (and his central midfield ‘unit’ partner Scholes, as they did in Barcelona) or Cantona or Beckham.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a TV-highlights-and-live-radio-only kind of fan I’ve seen and heard Alan Smith, Darren Fletcher, John O’Shea all do well in there. Let’s hope Scholesy can return and even that Giggsy is allowed to play out his last years through the middle.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Out wide we have Ronaldo, Park, Solskjaer and Richardson - we need reinforements there, too.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up front we look strong with Rooney, Ruud, Saha (when fit) and Rossi, although there’s always room for improvement.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What’s our first XI look like now? I don’t think Sir Alex knows, which is half the problem. Mine, assuming everyone is injury-free:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Howard - may as well give him his second chance, now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2 Neville - no brainer (the choice, not Gary) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 Heinze (leave him at full back for now) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 O’Shea (I’d like to see him given a run in the ‘holding’ role) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 Ferdinand (with O’Shea holding the defensive cover in midfield this would free up Rio to be more adventurous) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 Brown (he’s fit, playing well, give him a run) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 Ronaldo (just stick with him) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8 Rooney (start him wide left, but let him play wherever he sees fit like Eric did) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9 Saha (start as central striker) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 Van Nistelrooy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11 Giggs (central midfield role, playmaker, can swap with Rooney and Saha <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 Scholes (back up for Wayne or swap with Saha or Ruud for a less gung-ho approach!)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2nd XI: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Van der Sar <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2 Bardsley <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 Evra <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 Fortune <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 Vidic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 Silvestre <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 Park <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8 Fletcher <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9 Smith <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 Rossi <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11 Richardson <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 Solskjaer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->13 Pique<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Did I miss anyone?</p>
