		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There will be 14,800 new homes in 23 new developments in Southall over the next few years. 14 units over 10 stories high, and 7 over 20 stories high. Up to 40,000 new residents (and their cars)!</p>
<p>One third of the total new developments in the whole of Ealing borough (only Acton is getting it worse).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So not happening so much in the &lsquo;white&rsquo; or richer areas of the borough, for some reason.</p>
<p>None of these homes will be genuinely affordable to most people currently living in overcrowded homes in Southall or Ealing, as Studio bedsit flats start at around ¬£300,000!</p>
<p>Most will stay empty until they are sold to investors from China, Malaysia, Singapore, Bahrain(!) where they are actively marketed by the greedy property developers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The same property developers who gave former Ealing Council &lsquo;Leader&rsquo; Julian Bell and new Ealing Council &lsquo;Leader&rsquo; Peter Mason (also a Southall Green ward councillor) over ¬£30,000 in recent years to holiday in the south of France at the MIPIM property festival in Cannes described as a &ldquo;booze &lsquo;n&rsquo; hookerfest&rdquo; by Private Eye Magazine.</p>
<p>Bell says, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t cost the taxpayer a penny&rdquo;, but in Southall we are already paying with our health and quality of life thanks to the poisonous air from the development of the contaminated old gasworks site (due to complete in 2038!).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Town planner Mason says it was a mistake, and not what he expected(!).</p>
<p>Where will 40,000 new residents' children go to school (and how will they get there and back), how will they get an appointment to see a GP, which hospital will they go to when they need emergency treatment, and how will they get there on the roads already regularly gridlocked by too much traffic?</p>
<p>Worth taking the time to have a look at <a href="https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns.">stopthetowers.info/other-cam&hellip;</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Cllr Mason recommended we read Bob Colenutt&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Property Lobby: The Hidden Reality Behind the Housing Crisis&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>What Colenutt says (and he has a wealth of experience in local authority housing and planning, and in the community resisting property developers), is that developers do have too much power (as Mason argues), but also that local councils and councillors do not do enough to resist, do not have the negotiating skills (contrary to how Mason originally described the importance of trips to MIPIM to &lsquo;negotiate hard&rsquo;), and too readily embrace the &lsquo;financialisation&rsquo; of the land and property market brought about by David Cameron&rsquo;s and Nick Clegg&rsquo;s ConDem government in 2010.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So now, we have a very real housing crisis fuelling the huge profits of private developers, all facilitated and egged on by mostly Labour councils too easily rolling over and allowing them to build fewer and fewer &lsquo;genuinely affordable homes&rsquo; (because &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the profit in that?&quot;).</p>
<p>What Colenutt says loudly and clearly is that without ordinary people&rsquo;s and communities' resistance it would be so much worse, and that to all intents and purposes councils and councillors are in bed with the developers.</p>

<p>Body:</p>
<p>On 13 December Zarah Sultana MP  is presenting the #FreeSchoolMealsForAll Bill in Parliament.</p>
<p>The bill would extend Free School Meals to every child in primary school. It would support families and help ensure every child has the basics to grow and thrive.</p>
<p>MPs should back families, back children, and back the bill.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve just asked my MP to back the Bill. Can you ask your MP to do the same?</p>

			 <p>Six years ago <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wondered<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if the lack of Englishmen in Arsenal‚Äôs team (and most of the other leading Premier League teams) would herald a new era of Scotland-like failure for the England football team? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, thanks in part to Arsene Wenger‚Äôs penchant for Saintly youth team players (Theo, The Ox), we‚Äôre not quite there, yet, although undercover Scotsman Steve McClaren successfully tried and failed to qualify for Euro 2008.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mediocre<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But perhaps that also explains why there are now six players (Kelly, Johnson, Henderson, Downing, Carroll - and it‚Äôs debatable whether any of them would get into the current Scotland team - plus captain Gerrard) from a mid-table, mediocre Liverpool squad in the current England set-up?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Five years ago I blogged about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the problem with English football<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - how our ‚Äòlong history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world‚Äô perversely raises mainstream media expectations for the national side upon the start of any tournament for which we qualify. (Of course, I realise that they can hardly expect to win the ratings war and/or advertising revenue by informing potential viewers that it‚Äôs not likely to be New Improved England, but more Same Old England, if we‚Äôre lucky. Especially not when we need all the distraction we can get from the grim reality of how useless and fucked up our country is right now.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Failures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Had Gareth Barry not picked up an injury and had to withdraw from the current squad, England would almost certainly be starting Euro 2012 against France with the same successful central midfield system that ‚ÄòJocky‚Äô McClaren stumbled upon - Gerrard and Barry - just prior to his tactically innovative use of an umbrella as cover in the pissing rain and then being sacked and publicly humiliated for his efforts (which, statistically, were on a par with Sir Bobby Robson‚Äôs, and mirrored Sir Alf Ramsey‚Äôs and Robson‚Äôs failures to qualify for their first tournaments in charge). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two years ago I successfully predicted (admittedly, not hard to do) that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->England didn‚Äôt have a hope in hell of winning the World Cup in South Africa<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The good news this time around is that Joe Hart is in goal and that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äòlumbering hulk of long-ball fodder who couldn‚Äôt score a goal even if you put it in front of him and offered him ¬£50,000 a week‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, also known as Emile Heskey, is not even on the standby list (although Andy Carroll does look like a handy replacement).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Left at home<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bad news is that the only English defender we have who has actually proved himself in tournament football, Rio Ferdinand, has been left at home by Old Mother Hodgson because he is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scorpio<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our defence, therefore, is likely to be the same as that which kept out the mighty Algeria, and the smallest nation at the finals two years ago, Slovenia, but with Phil Jagielka or Joleon Lescott replacing former England captain Ferdinand (who of course, was himself replaced before the tournament began due to injury by the injury-prone Ledley King, who of course, was himself replaced due to injury in the first game by Jamie Carragher, who of course, was himself replaced in the third game due to being crap by, er, Stoke bench-warmer Matthew Upson) alongside racist philanderer, and former England captain (twice over) John Terry.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As good a defence, in effect, as that which went on to concede four goals to a proper team, Germany.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Failures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moving on to the midfield (if we can keep possession of the football for long enough) it looks like England will be starting with the same creative talents as in South Africa, bar the injured Barry and Lampard, who will be replaced by the injured Parker and Gerrard. Milner or Walcott (for footballing reasons, presumably) are likely to come in for Aaron Lennon on the right, with Stewart Downing (for footballing reasons‚Ä¶ oh, wait) taking over from Milner/Gerrard on the left. Despite my longing for Downing to score the winning goal in a penalty shoot-out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the final against the Germans<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this midfield quartet cannot in any way be described as an improvement on 2010‚Äôs fiasco, or even 2008‚Äôs failures.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up front, of course, England will have to play proper teams France and Sweden without Wayne Rooney, our one truly world class player. By the time he‚Äôs eligible to play in England‚Äôs final group game against the co-hosts Ukraine, England are quite likely to be needing a win to have any hope of even qualifying for the quarter-finals.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thoroughly outplayed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->England‚Äôs two warm-up games have followed a similar pattern to those in 2010, although perhaps offering a glimmer of hope where two years ago there really was none. In 2010, England were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äòthoroughly outplayed at Wembley by Mexico, only winning by virtue of having taller players, and then, in Austria, thoroughly outplayed by the equally diminutive Japan, only winning by virtue of two fortuitous own goals‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In 2012, England were thoroughly outplayed in Norway, only winning by virtue of a sublime piece of skill from Ashley Young, and then, at Wembley, thoroughly outplayed by Belgium, only winning by virtue of a sublime piece of skill from Danny Welbeck.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Humiliation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspect that England‚Äôs tournament will pan out in equally inglorious fashion, beginning with defeat at the feet of the French, put to the sword in a dire draw by the Swedes, and ignominious exit in the rain against Ukraine. To cope with the likely onset of boredom, depression and homicidal rage, I recommend following the same principles as in my guide to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The World Cup on drugs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if England‚Äôs special brand of austerity football means avoiding the pain of humiliation against Spain in the quarter-finals, then it‚Äôs surely all for the greater good.</p>

			 <p>A long time ago, back in January 2010 in fact, Dan Lynch‚Äôs band 20lb Sounds released their song Jimmy Carter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->20lb Sounds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) / <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CC BY-SA 3.0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is our first original release. It‚Äôs called Jimmy Carter and as you might expect it‚Äôs about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ Jimmy Carter, the former US president. We didn‚Äôt set out to write a song about him particularly, it‚Äôs just that someone came out with the line ‚ÄúJimmy Carter was a peanut farmer‚Äù, and it had to be put into song. After a quick trawl of his Wikipedia page we were turning up all sorts of gems. Such as Jimmy Carter is the cousin of Motown Records supremo Berry Gordy, he‚Äôs also won a Nobel Peace prize and even a Grammy award. Mad huh?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All those nuggets of trivia found their way into the lyrics. It was originally just the main riff but then other sections were written to make it a bit more interesting as a full song. It‚Äôs hard to know what to describe this as, it‚Äôs almost country blues, but somehow not. There‚Äôs a bit of harmonica thrown in there so watch out for that too.

			 <p>If England‚Äôs game against Algeria had been a Wimbledon tennis match, the two sides would still be at it today with the Dutch Master Johan Cruyff declaring it the greatest example of Total Crap Football ever played.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Both sets of players would be awarded (honorary) knighthoods for their part in simulating Barnsley versus Grimsby Town at a freezing cold Oakwell on New Year‚Äôs Day in the late 1990s/early 2000s and no doubt the two managers would be encased in marble as a living testament to their obduracy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if the first round of group games were like pure-grade heroin cut with shavings of Clive Tyldesley and smuggled past England‚Äôs Robert Green at UK border control, I have to admit that I overdosed, taking up to six hours a day for more than a week.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After an early rush of excitement, I fell into a deep reverie induced by triple daily doses of drab defensive displays before finally lapsing into a tactical coma, waking up just in time for this Sunday‚Äôs World Cup Final showdown between England and Germany.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Having beaten the USA in the knockout stages, Fabio Capello must be delighted that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his masterplan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has come to fruition and England are within 90 minutes of lifting the Jules Rimet trophy once more.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A valiant effort, all the more remarkable as we have scored only two goals in the process of knocking out the most powerful nation on earth (truly, an us against US game if ever there was one), the tricky North Africans and then the smallest footballing nation at the Finals, Slovenia.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I take my hat off to Fabio and his men and will go on to eat it for dinner, too, as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was convinced we really didn‚Äôt have a hope in hell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of seeing this dream come true.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a tribute, I offer my exclusive guide to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The World Cup On Drugs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for your viewing enhancement:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alcohol<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Preferably beer and lots of it. Great for encouraging your team‚Äôs hard men to go in for dangerous two-footed tackles on opponents. Can really make you feel good for 90 minutes, but then you can start to get heavy-legged and risk missing vital goals while you go for a pee. Can also leave you feeling tired and miserable for days afterwards if you‚Äôre over 40.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Undoubtedly the football fan‚Äôs favourite tipple, alcohol can make even France versus Uruguay seem like the most compelling game of end-to-end football you‚Äôve ever seen. OK, maybe not even alcohol can do that. Which is why you might consider some slightly more risqu√© alternatives.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cannabis and marijuana<!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you smoke or otherwise consume enough of this, you won‚Äôt care who wins as long as you have plenty of chocolate and crisps. Not a good idea to try ordering a Chinese takeaway while watching either of the two Korean sides, either, unless you want bean curd noodles with prawn cracker soup and a meat cleaver in your head for being a cheeky bastard.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may find yourself laughing uncontrollably at the little Mexican and Japanese players (but see LSD, below) and at some of the many comedy commentating double-entendres and other funnies such as:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bougherra goes in hard on Butt!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->He‚Äôs got Eggiman on the face, there.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Messi leaves Shittu trailing in his wake.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pantsil‚Äôs off!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bong.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amphetamines, ecstacy and cocaine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In theory, you might think any of these stimulants would be great for staying alert during the opening round of games, but as your brain processes information faster so these interminable games begin to last forever and - as we all know - you risk irreversible catatonia.

This is what all BBC and ITV commentators take before live games. You have been warned.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->LSD and magic mushrooms<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hallucinogens. Watch football and expand your mind. Sounds too good to be true! Discover the meaning of life during the national anthems and spend the rest of the day communicating with the God of the Vuvuzelas or hiding in the cupboard under the stairs fearing that you are about to be abducted by giant lizard-men disguised as tiny insects working for your local council‚Äôs refuse collection team.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Either way, it will be a life-changing experience. When watching Japan or Mexico, be prepared to spend the entire game marvelling at how small their players are and how big the opposition is. Whatever you do, you will need to read the sports news the following day in order to find out what really happened.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heroin, morphine and other opiate derivatives<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Can make you feel like you won even when you lost.

			 <p>Fabio Capello‚Äôs master plan to take England to the World Cup final is finally taking shape.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the evidence seen so far, truly it is something of a fantasy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sorry bunch of posers (Wayne Rooney, our only hope and Sid Vicious-like talisman ready to self-destruct at any moment, excepted) that represent our once proud nation may fail even to qualify for the ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It‚Äôs A Knockout<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô stages let alone reach the final for what would be our finest hour-and-half (plus extra-time and penalties, if needed) for 44 years.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If by some bloody miracle we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reach the final, I just hope we don‚Äôt live to regret not thinking about a master plan to actually win it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But our preparations - highlights of which include being thoroughly outplayed at Wembley by Mexico and only winning by virtue of having taller players and then today in Austria being thoroughly outplayed by the equally diminutive Japan and only winning by virtue of two fortuitous own goals - are now over.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even if he won‚Äôt be singing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->God Save The Queen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, at least Capello now knows who his 23 will be. Here, I can exclusively reveal who they will be and why.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In goal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In reverse order, building from the back as all England teams do, Capello already knew who his three goalkeepers would be.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->David James, who has made something of a career littered with often hilarious yet calamitous mistakes (which must give hope for the future to Ben Foster), was first choice until his injury at Portsmouth allowed Rob Green, who seems to be compiling his own personal back catalogue of often hilarious yet calamitous mistakes, to take over.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ironically, the best of the lot could be the young but inexperienced third choice Joe Hart.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While I think Capello must have been tempted by James‚Äôs much greater experience, I think he will stick with Rob Green to start knowing that he has capable back up if needed due to loss of form, injury or suspension.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Robert GREEN<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the back<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lazily rolling the ball out to the defence, Capello knows his preferred back four of Glen Johnson, captain Rio Ferdinand, John Terry and Ashley Cole, the two Chelsea players competing for the role of Johnny Rotten.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The question is, how does he balance the ideal of having like-for-like back up while making sure he has enough options to cover for lack of form and fitness after injury?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That will depend to some extent on Gareth Barry‚Äôs injury as he would be the natural choice to cover for Ashley Cole and a better option, if fit, than the specialist left back Leighton Baines, who has looked out of his depth at this level.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2 Glen JOHNSON 3 Ashley COLE 4 Gareth BARRY 5 Rio FERDINAND 6 John TERRY<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the middle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Calmly passing the ball out to the midfield, again Capello knows his first choice is for Frank Lampard to partner Gareth Barry in the middle, with Steven Gerrard and Theo Walcott out wide.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->With Barry‚Äôs injury it‚Äôs likely that Gerrard will be asked to fill in centrally in preference to an out-of-sorts Michael Carrick or the impressive but still inexperienced James Milner, who will be trusted to take Gerrard‚Äôs starting place on the left in England‚Äôs first game against the USA.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 Theo WALCOTT 8 Frank LAMPARD<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up front<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Desperately hoofing the ball up to the forwards now and giving the ball away, bizarrely we once again have the lovely Emile Heskey as our first choice centre forward.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It‚Äôs like being back in 2002 all over again, except that back then Heskey was just a lumbering hulk of long-ball fodder who couldn‚Äôt score a goal even if you put it in front of him and offered him ¬£50,000 a week.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heskey‚Äôs England career, like Gareth Barry‚Äôs of course, was reconstructed by former England manager and still object of derision (mostly for being so wet, despite sensibly opting for an umbrella to keep the rain off while his England team failed not to lose their must-not-lose game against Croatia) Steve McClaren.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even so, Heskey is believed to be Rooney‚Äôs preferred strike partner, presumably because he makes him look even better.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->9 Emile HESKEY 10 Wayne ROONEY 11 Steven GERRARD<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Left back at home<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think Capello must have been tempted to take only three specialist, but versatile central defenders as cover - King (who can also play a holding role in midfield), Jamie Carragher (who can cover both full-back roles as just as badly as centre back) and Matt Upson (who could conceivably cover at left-back if needed).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The advantage of taking Baines as well is that even if we had three players out with injury or suspension we would still have a defender on the bench.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But Capello must surely think that better options, in the unlikely event they are even needed, are the versatility of Michael Carrick, who has played a central defensive role a couple of times for United and James Milner, who can fill in on either flank as a full-back. Christ, I‚Äôd rather have Gerrard and Rooney at full back than Baines.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stephen Warnock and Michael Dawson are untested alternatives, and I don‚Äôt see the point of Leighton Baines, so I don‚Äôt see how Capello can either.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 David JAMES 13 Jamie CARRAGHER 14 Ledley KING 15 Matt UPSON<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Passed out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other benefit of not taking Leighton Baines is that it frees up a place for a more attack-minded player.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While Capello has a had a good look at Tom Huddlestone, who has played well for Spurs this season, I think he will miss out along with Scott Parker who was the injury reserve, and stick with the experience of Michael Carrick, despite his fairly miserable recent run of form.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aaron Lennon is the preferred like-for-like replacement for Walcott.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->16 Aaron LENNON 17 Michael CARRICK 18 James MILNER<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bent over<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Peter Crouch and Jermain Defoe were always certainties to go and Darren Bent never really had a chance.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->19 Peter CROUCH 20 Jermain DEFOE<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tossed off<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe Cole, who must think he looks more and more like a fat Joe Cole with every pie he eats, offers experienced and creative cover in any attacking midfield role.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That leaves exciting new boy Adam Johnson fighting for a place with his little big-club team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips, who, like Glenn Matlock, can feel a little hard done by.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just like at City, expect Johnson, who can genuinely play on either wing, to get the nod in the potential-matchwinner-who-won‚Äôt-even-get-on role.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->21 Joe COLE 22 Adam JOHNSON 23 Joe HART<!-- raw HTML omitted -->So there you have it, to put you out of your misery two days early.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank me in the comments.</p>

			 <p>The only United match I‚Äôve been to in recent years was last season‚Äôs FA Cup tie at home to Spurs, courtesy of E.on‚Äôs sponsorship and their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Family Football<!-- raw HTML omitted --> initiative. I went with a couple of my ‚Äòclients‚Äô from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->work<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, had a great road trip and fantastic all-round experience. One‚Äôs a Spurs fan, and I know he felt a mixture of joy and anxiety sat in amongst all the United fans (even in the Family stand) when Spurs went 1-0 up. But both were amazed by the genuine friendliness and good-natured humour of the locals as we mingled around outside the stadium before kick-off. I‚Äôm pleased to say that both are working or about to start work now. I really believe that going to this match (and we also went to Wembley and White Hart Lane) helped to put a bit of the spark back into their lives, to begin to believe and to hope again. The Theatre of Dreams, indeed!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I went to a few games in the ‚Äô90s when I was working in Manchester, mostly European nights, which then weren‚Äôt that well supported. I remember seeing David Beckham play one of his first games and you could see right away that he was a special talent. Before that, I saw Roy Keane when he was still at Forest. I think he scored a hat-trick at Bolton (where I was studying) and he was another one that you could see was on another level, right away. My favourite game in the 90‚Äôs, though, has to be Sheffield United away in a midweek game. We won 3-0, fabulous counter-attacking stuff and fantastic goals from Cantona, Hughes and Sharpe!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back to the late 70‚Äôs again, my dad took me to see United get walloped 4-0 at OT by Cloughie‚Äôs Forest and I saw the 3-5 thrashing we received at the hands of West Brom, not to mention the 0-0 versus Wolves with George Berry. We were frigging crap a lot of the time, occasionally brilliant, but never consistently good enough.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have a lot to thank my dad for. Thanks, Dad! He got me a Subbuteo set one Xmas and meticulously painted on the United colours, numbers and even facial hair of the players. I was gutted when my ickle Lou Macari broke both legs and he was never the same player again despite being able to return for the next match thanks to a tube of superglue!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The best thing about all of this, though, is being able to immediately rebut all the ABUs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who, when I tell them who I support, start their tired old accusations of glory-hunting, London Reds, etc. I started watching United when they were at their lowest ebb (in terms of league status) since they became popular worldwide. I‚Äôve personally endured almost twenty of the ‚Äúyears of hurt‚Äù growing up watching those other reds (funny how so many of the kids I went to school with in Lincolnshire were Liverpool fans) win year after year with just a few crumbs of comfort coming our way in the FA Cup. Both my mum and dad were and still are ardent United supporters and if it wasn‚Äôt for them I‚Äôd probably be a Mariner or worse!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, thanks, mum and dad, for uniting and ensuring that I was born in Stretford General!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fans of ‚ÄòAnyone but United‚Äô. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Ü©<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>It‚Äôs often the case that what in one sense is an undeniable strength can at the same time also be a real or potential weakness. English football‚Äôs great history and tradition raises everyone‚Äôs expectations, yet the English football team must compete on an increasingly commercialised and sophisticated international playing field. We have more fans, more money and more foreigners in our game than any other country, so it‚Äôs no surprise that when things don‚Äôt go to plan, everyone feels quite upset and let down. And the media does its best to blame anyone and everyone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There‚Äôs such a lot at stake, now. It was only sixty years or so ago that the Football Association, which is now grieving over the financial loss of failure to qualify for Euro 2008 and stating that qualification for Euro and World Cup Finals is a minimum requirement of the team manager/coach, actively prevented the national team from taking part. It‚Äôs only forty years or so since we won it. As it happens, Sir Alf Ramsey, like Second Choice Steve McClaren also failed to qualify for his first Euro Finals in 1964‚Ä¶. We have a long history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world, so it‚Äôs not as if it‚Äôs anything new or that we should be surprised about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with English football has been documented in the press as being anything from too many foreign players, too much money, expectation of fans not matched with reality, players and coaches not good enough, not enough passion or care, too much passion and not enough technique, too much pressure and fear, too much drinking and not enough team spirit. The reality is probably that all of these factors are important to a lesser or greater degree. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too many foreign players<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Sven-Goran Erikkson points out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, managers often buy overseas players because they are cheaper on average than their English or British counterparts. That‚Äôs also why so few of our players play abroad - because there isn‚Äôt the money to pay them, not necessarily that they aren‚Äôt good enough. Beckham was and arguably still is good enough to play for Real Madrid. That‚Äôs why there are too many foreign players.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much money<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So part of the problem may be that the players get paid too much? But that is not the players‚Äô fault, just market forces, mainly to do with Sky TV money and, er, the FA, who contract with them for Premier League (the same FA which hijacked the Football League) and England rights. What this means is that the very best English players - who are on a par at least, with the very best players in the world - are paid significantly more. This is why Arsene Wenger has so few English players in his squad, not because they aren‚Äôt good enough, but because they are too expensive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The new Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but it seems to me that we are repeating what happened in Scotland during the Graeme Souness era at Rangers - he bought lots of foreigners in, Celtic and others later followed suit and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Scottish national team suffered as a result<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôm not the only one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who thinks that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->England are the new Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The recent Scottish revival has surely been due to Rangers and Celtic developing a core group of home-grown players to complement their foreign signings. And I‚Äôm sure that a lot of their England based players can‚Äôt wait to get a game for Scotland after watching too many games from the stand or playing for less successful clubs!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overpaid English players<!-- raw HTML omitted -->At club level, Arsenal are successful in part at least because they have a salary structure which prevents them buying overpaid English players, but keeps team spirit up - see how much better they are doing without the overpaid Henry! Same with United to a different extent. Fergie‚Äôs discipline is what he buys by paying top wages and Ince, Kanchelskis, Beckham, Van Nistelrooy and Keane are all examples of players who reached their sell-by dates, for the team‚Äôs eventual benefit. Chelsea pay everyone top wages, of course, while my guess is that the likes of Liverpool, Newcastle, Spurs and any other under-achievers get the balance wrong between wages and value.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much pressure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there‚Äôs more to it than that. Michael Owen says that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the players can‚Äôt cope with the pressure of playing for England now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not that they don‚Äôt care. Although at some point we have to admit that other teams are sometimes better than us, that would certainly explain some lacklustre performances and results. Where does the pressure come from? The fans? The media?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My opinion is that the fans want England to win, or - if they can‚Äôt win - to play well, trying. The media just want to sell stories, and their marketing strategy is the time-honoured sensationalism of even the most mundane non-news (Steve McClaren under an umbrella. OK, so he looked a bit daft, but, if he kept dry and we‚Äôd won‚Ä¶). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we lost to Croatia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What we should all have been saying was congratulations to Croatia on a deserved victory and let‚Äôs support McClaren in  rebuilding for real this time instead of picking on every little thing and waiting for him to fail. Things looked good against Russia and Israel, he stumbled across a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù (Gerrard and Barry) that worked. He was unlucky with injuries, but should have been given longer.</p>

			 <p>United‚Äôs FA Cup tie with Wolves last weekend and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Auntie‚Äôs ‚Äòflashback‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Rio Ferdinand?), reminded me to finally get around to posting a few of my own memories, originally prompted by George Best‚Äôs sad demise in November.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->George had quit United long before I can first remember watching them. But Best remained an important part of my United life - the school chant was ‚ÄúGeorgie Best, Superstar, He walks like a woman and he wears a bra!‚Äù - and Dad would always remind me that whatever ‚Äúmy‚Äù United did they were never as good as Best, Law an Charlton and the rest of Busby‚Äôs Babes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can see what he meant, now! And he did concede that watching Cantona, Kanchelskis and Giggs at their peak was probably just as exciting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, 1974-5 season was my first, when United were in the old League Division Two. I didn‚Äôt understand the significance of the different divisions then, just enjoyed the BBC‚Äôs and Yorkshire TV‚Äôs occasional match coverage when we took on the regional challengers of the time - the big guns of York City, Rotherham United, Hull City and Sheffield Wednesday, if my memory serves me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That year we won the D2 title and returned to the top division.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We then got to three out of the next four Cup Finals (when that meant something), winning just once (but against Treble-chasing Liverpool).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six years after we had won the European Cup with Best, Law, Charlton and the rest we had teams comprising (as I remember them):<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Alex Stepney, then Paddy Roche, then Gary Bailey <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2 Alex Forsyth, then Jimmy Nichol <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 Stuart Houston, then Arthur Albiston (who popped up on Five Live recently) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 Gerry Daly, then Brian Greenhof, then Sammy McIlroy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 Brian Greenhoff, then Gordon McQueen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 Martin Buchan (c) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 Steve Coppell <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8 Sammy McIlroy, then Jimmy Greenhoff <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9 Stuart Pearson, then Joe Jordan <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 Lou Macari <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11 Gordon Hill, then Mickey Thomas <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 David McCreery, then Ashley Grimes<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stepney was a legend, the last of Sir Matt‚Äôs European Champions. Bailey was talented - I remember a couple of full-stretch diving saves he made in the 5-3 home defeat by West Brom‚Ä¶.Houston was the first person I‚Äôd ever heard tell someone else to fuck off. That he did it in response to baiting from a total stranger on the terraces was even more startling to me then.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ever since I always had a sense that Houston was quite evil. I‚Äôm sure he isn‚Äôt! It reminds me, too, of the televised live England game when Ray Wilkins told the (Uruguyan?) ball boy to ‚Äúgive me the fucking ball‚Äù. Not to mention when Eric jumped into the crowd feet first!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->McIlroy was ‚Äòthe last of the Busby Babes‚Äô (probably also ‚Äòthe new George Best‚Äô), but never quite managed to live up to it, despite being a great servant to the club. I was really sad when he had to leave not long after Bryan Robson and Remi Moses arrived a few years later. Not long before he moved on he scored a fantastic solo goal against Wolves.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Buchan was the ever-dependable rock and heartbeat of the team. Scored a couple of last minute<!-- raw HTML omitted -->equalisers, drives from outside the penalty area, one at home to Everton?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Coppell had an economics degree apparently. Probably would make a good manager one day‚Ä¶. Career cut short by injury.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pearson was an up-and-at-them, no fear, old-fashioned centre forward, replaced by Joe Jordan, an up-and-at-them, no fear, old-fashioned centre forward with no front teeth. Wonderful!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Macari was the mischief-maker-in-chief, apparently ran a chip shop outside the ground and provided the role model for free-scoring (Celtic) strikers to sign for United, dry up and move back into midfield‚Ä¶.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gordon Hill‚Äôs demise was a source of childhood grief for me, which even now I find difficult to understand. Lee Sharpe followed suit more recently. Thomas was a cheeky-chappy, work-hard, play-hard type with silly hair.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->McCreery was our not-so-supersub and Grimes was never a United player, surely?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Which brings me back to the current team/squad. Who are the Ashley Grimeses of today? Van der Sar looks a bit like Paddy Roche, but so did Roy Carroll. We need a world class keeper, still.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gary Neville will be looking forward to the Liverpool rematch in the Cup, no doubt!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wes Brown might still come through as genuine class, but realistically he‚Äôs always going to be a squaddie. Same applies to Mikael Silvestre. Gabriel Heinze has been missed and I expect he will partner Rio in central defence next season, that‚Äôs if Patrice Evra comes through at left back.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then there‚Äôs Vidic, O‚ÄôShea, Richardson, Bardsley‚Ä¶.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who will replace Roy Keane? That‚Äôs probably the wrong question. Football‚Äôs a team game and the best teams don‚Äôt rely on one player, but on individuals gelling as units within the team. United at their best could win without Keane (and his central midfield ‚Äòunit‚Äô partner Scholes, as they did in Barcelona) or Cantona or Beckham.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a TV-highlights-and-live-radio-only kind of fan I‚Äôve seen and heard Alan Smith, Darren Fletcher, John O‚ÄôShea all do well in there. Let‚Äôs hope Scholesy can return and even that Giggsy is allowed to play out his last years through the middle.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Out wide we have Ronaldo, Park, Solskjaer and Richardson - we need reinforements there, too.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up front we look strong with Rooney, Ruud, Saha (when fit) and Rossi, although there‚Äôs always room for improvement.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What‚Äôs our first XI look like now? I don‚Äôt think Sir Alex knows, which is half the problem. Mine, assuming everyone is injury-free:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Howard - may as well give him his second chance, now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2 Neville - no brainer (the choice, not Gary) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 Heinze (leave him at full back for now) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 O‚ÄôShea (I‚Äôd like to see him given a run in the ‚Äòholding‚Äô role) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 Ferdinand (with O‚ÄôShea holding the defensive cover in midfield this would free up Rio to be more adventurous) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 Brown (he‚Äôs fit, playing well, give him a run) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 Ronaldo (just stick with him) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8 Rooney (start him wide left, but let him play wherever he sees fit like Eric did) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9 Saha (start as central striker) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 Van Nistelrooy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11 Giggs (central midfield role, playmaker, can swap with Rooney and Saha <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 Scholes (back up for Wayne or swap with Saha or Ruud for a less gung-ho approach!)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2nd XI: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Van der Sar <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2 Bardsley <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 Evra <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 Fortune <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 Vidic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 Silvestre <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 Park <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8 Fletcher <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9 Smith <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 Rossi <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11 Richardson <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 Solskjaer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->13 Pique<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Did I miss anyone?</p>
