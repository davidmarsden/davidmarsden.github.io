			 <p>&lsquo;The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says the building was targeted because it was a Hezbollah &ldquo;terrorist command centre&rdquo; and it &ldquo;eliminated&rdquo; a Hezbollah commander. It added that &ldquo;the overwhelming majority&rdquo; of those killed in the strike were &ldquo;confirmed to be terror operatives&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But a BBC Eye investigation verified the identity of 68 of the 73 people killed in the attack and uncovered evidence suggesting just six were linked to Hezbollah&rsquo;s military wing. None of those we identified appeared to hold a senior rank. The BBC&rsquo;s World Service also found that the other 62 were civilians - 23 of them children.&rsquo;</p>

			 <p>On Sunday I was listening to Lianne La Havas' COLORS rendition of &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/_YOvQNgpfXY">Bittersweet</a>&rdquo; on YouTube.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôre picking that fight everyday<br>
This shit‚Äôs going nowhere</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Algorithm did its job well and showed me the latest KEXP concert by a new to me band called <a href="https://youtu.be/Qeo4GZMe-FE">English Teacher</a>. I was blown away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve seen more COLORS Shows than KEXPs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit prog at times, and a lot music studenty, but they can really play so that&rsquo;s all forgiven, especially if you listen to the interview with the band at the end of the full concert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/OPm0hwBbtnI">Albert Road</a>&rdquo; is possibly my favourite, although I think the recorded version is even better and more poignant with the video (especially in light of the drama of the last couple of days):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Steve&rsquo;s mate&rsquo;s son used to play in The Fall&hellip;)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So don&rsquo;t take our prejudice to heart<br>
We hate everyone<br>
The world around us never showed<br>
How loving can be fun</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than The Fall, they somehow remind me of The Sugarcubes, who I loved back in the late 80s, but who I haven&rsquo;t listened to properly for a long time. I listened to the album &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s Too Good&rdquo; this afternoon while working, and it was better than I remember it. &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/fq2dWTBVZD4">Deus</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He put me in a bath tub<br>
Made me squeaky clean</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently Bjork&rsquo;s producer produced English Teacher&rsquo;s album.</p>
<p>More reminiscent of The Fall (and Frank Sidebottom), perhaps, is their song (and video) about the singer&rsquo;s smalltown hometown of Colne in Lancashire and its inflated egos, &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/YNkbgumvYyA">The World&rsquo;s Biggest Paving Slab</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the world&rsquo;s biggest paving slab<br>
So watch your fucking feet</p>
</blockquote>
