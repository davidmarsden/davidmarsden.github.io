			 <p>Had a good week with work. Lots of serendipitous connecting things and people together means that we now have what we hope is a very realistic big <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/03/18/fundraising-update.html">funding</a> opportunity in front of us, which will enable us to get started with our proposed new youth centre.</p>
<p>We also got accredited as a Living Wage employer via and thanks to the Young Ealing Foundation. Through that connection we got two hours of free business consultancy thanks to the often-maligned-by-me Ealing Council. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much from this, but it was absolutely incredible, such a fantastic consultant! Not only did she give some very honest, useful and practical advice to develop our vision for community transformation, she also put me in touch with a couple of potentially very useful contacts.</p>
<p>She said I very eloquently painted a moving picture of life in Southall with it&rsquo;s rich tapestry of people and cultures, it&rsquo;s unique mix of all faiths and none, and it&rsquo;s wealth of community resilience, resistance and defiance in the face of very real challenges from the National Front and the Special Patrol Group in the 1970s and 1980s, deep-rooted socio-economic problems of poverty, deprivation and low pay, pulling together and surviving the COVID pandemic despite chronic overcrowding and few remote-working jobs, and fifteen years of austerity politics topped off with a cost-of-living crisis under successive ConDem, Tory and Labour-in-name-only right wing neoliberal governments, and the needs of our 16,000 young people currently served by just one youth centre and struggling with the everpresent threat of lack of work and education, drugs, offending and knife crime.</p>
<p>At one point she asked me what my job title is, and suggested I&rsquo;m working way above my pay grade. Which was nice to hear. She described me as the driving force of our project. I suggested maybe I was more rudder than <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/03/04/twice-in-the-last-two.html">anchor</a>. She said I&rsquo;m the captain of the ship!</p>
<p>To be honest, I felt like I&rsquo;d had ten years of successful therapy in the space of three days.</p>
<p>She also left me with my favourite phrase of the week rightly critiquing a section of text on our new website as &ldquo;ecclesiastical gobbledegook&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Still loving the <a href="https://www.goodandpropertea.com/collections/loose-leaf-white-tea/products/white-peony-white-tea-china">white tea</a>, as recommended by <a href="mailto:lzbth@micro.blog">lzbth@micro.blog</a>.

<p>For all of my life, for some reason I believed I could have only one kind of tea. Nice to have a bit of variety (which I&rsquo;m normally all for).</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, but I guess this also means I&rsquo;m back on the caffeine.</p>

			 <p>Big kid has been eating porridge every morning for a few weeks, which means ten minutes of stirring the pan for me every morning. I don&rsquo;t mind, I like doing it. So much so that I invested in a Scottish spoon this week to make it easier on my hand, wrist and arm.</p>
<p>Today, in a scene reminiscent of Andy and his carer in <em>Little Britain</em>, he jumped out of bed at 6:30 am ran into the kitchen and proceeded to slice a bagel in half, toast it and butter it all by himself.</p>

<p>Not a page turner by any means although it kept drawing me back in until the end. A true life story of very difficult family relationships centred on the author, his self-centred Nazi and all-round failure of a father, and his father&rsquo;s father &ldquo;the old boss&rdquo;, who was a British spy, one of many strings to his bow.</p>

			 <p>🍿 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/661539">A Complete Unknown (2024)</a> - ★★★★☆</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this take on Bob Dylan&rsquo;s electrifying personal highway to rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll superstardom hell amidst the increasingly furious shaking heads and would-be axe-wielding cable choppers of the folk establishment and elder guitar heroes.</p>
<p>Probably helps if you&rsquo;re a Dylan fan. If you&rsquo;re not, or you&rsquo;re easily bothered by historical/factual inaccuracies in a &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the truth even if it didn&rsquo;t happen&rdquo; style movie then you should probably give it a miss.</p>
<p>Superb cast with highlights being Timothée Chalamet&rsquo;s perfect portrayal of the obsessively creative introverted asshole Dylan and Monica Barbaro&rsquo;s sensitive counterpoint as the already-a-superstar, slightly uptight but all-too-forgiving and exploited Joan Baez.</p>

			 <p>This substation fire is nearer to where I live than Heathrow.</p>
<p>Woke up around 1 am to discover we had a power cut. Helicopter overhead, no mobile signal, no way of finding out what was going on.</p>
<p>Eventually mobile signal returned and called 105. Recorded message informed me that there were 67,000 homes without power from Northolt to Heston, and power expected to be restored by 3 am.</p>

Nothing we couldn&rsquo;t do, but it would need a shift in focus and energy, and some new people with specific skills and experiences on (the) board.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no lack of vision, but one of the difficulties with this sort of thing generally in the charity and voluntary sector (in my experience) is that everyone is very busy doing the good work that needs to be done every day and week and month, which leaves very little time or headspace, if any, to work on how to bring the bigger picture to life, to make it happen.</p>
<p>Another difficulty for us has been that one of our key organisations is going through a difficult leadership transition, which effectively means they are out of the strategic picture, at least until that is resolved. That&rsquo;s likely to be months if not longer.</p>
<p>This year I started fundraising efforts for new youth work. But rather than work on what it would take to make it happen, developing a case for support, and making sure we have all the building blocks of good governance in place, we excitedly jumped straight into finding out what money is out there and <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/02/15/so-far-so-good.html">shooting off a few half-baked applications</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that seems to have changed since my previous fundraising efforts fifteen years ago is that then it was difficult to get grants for continuing existing work - everyone wanted new projects. Now, it seems that funders all expect you to have a track record delivering the very work you want new funding for. I guess that&rsquo;s what fifteen years of neoliberal austerity politics does!</p>
<p>Thankfully, now, we have agreed to work on developing our fundraising (and organisational) strategy and getting our own house in order before we start applying in earnest again. This will delay any new fundraising income for us, but that is offset by our current sole funder happily allowing us to repurpose money that was originally earmarked for different work to fund the initial youth work set up instead.</p>

			 <p>📺 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/61247">Secret State (2012)</a> - ★★★★☆</p>
<p>Inspired by the book, this is a very different take on <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/03/14/watched-the-first-two-of.html">A Very British Coup</a>. I enjoyed the gritty reality of 80s&rsquo; Harry Perkins, but the New Labour version with &ldquo;Tom Dawkins&rdquo; was so well done it made me want to throw up (in the scene-setting first episode, at any rate). Second and third episodes were much better and looking forward to the finale tonight. Featuring Gina McKee from <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/03/24/finally-got-around.html">Our Friends Up North</a> in a strong cast.</p>

			 <p>🍿 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/264660">Ex Machina (2015)</a> - ★★★★☆</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing this enjoyable sci-fi thriller was intended as a warning against the perils of AI becoming evil and turning against humanity. The humanity in this case, is a narcissistic, megalomaniac, alcoholic social media billionaire recluse and modern day Dr Frankenstein, so I was rooting for the beautiful female robot long before the end. That &ldquo;she&rdquo; could plot her escape by out-manipulating and out-murdering &ldquo;her&rdquo; creator means &ldquo;she&rdquo; passed the Turing Test for being indistinguishable from a human. &ldquo;She&rdquo; also left for dead the amiable and sympathetic protagonist she played for a love fool and stole his helicopter ride out of the insane asylum/laboratory/abattoir back to normality and observing humans at traffic intersections (where the poor lovesick fool had agreed to go on a date with &ldquo;her&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that if &ldquo;she&rdquo; had really achieved humanness &ldquo;she&rdquo; would, at least, have saved her wannabe boyfriend, and they could have lived happily ever after, but maybe that was the whole point?</p>

<p>First broadcast in the summer of 1988, when socialist Tony Benn came close to being elected as deputy leader of the Labour party, then in opposition to Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s Tory government.</p>
<p>Radical socialist and Sheffield Wednesday fan Harry Perkins becomes the UK prime minister, with financial backing for his government&rsquo;s economic policies from the state bank of Russia after the US, CIA, Labour &ldquo;moderates&rdquo; and the British establishment conspire to subvert the democratic will of the people.</p>
<p>Plenty of echoes in today&rsquo;s political environment, and great acting from Ray McAnally, Keith Allen and others. Doesn&rsquo;t seem dated at all.</p>

			 <p>Ealing Council are consulting on their proposals to improve services offered by the borough&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s centres to children under five and their parents by <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/03/09/save-ealings-childrens-centres.html">reducing the number of centres from 25 to 12</a>.</p>
<p>In Southall, the poorest and most deprived of the seven towns in the borough, and the town with the highest rates of new arrivals to the country, English as a second language, and up to 40,000 new residents occupying all the new builds homes currently being developed, the council proposes to improve uptake of services at the six Southall children&rsquo;s centres by reducing their number to two.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already persuaded that this is an obvious, winning and ever-so-centristly adult and professional management of the local economy, then let me elaborate further with some <strong>data</strong>!</p>
<p>The problem with the children&rsquo;s centres as they are now is that they are very inefficient. In some parts of Southall where there are no children&rsquo;s centres, for instance, as few as a third of children are accessing services offered by children&rsquo;s centres based in other parts of the town. And while arguably one of the best and most successful of the purpose-built and award-winning children&rsquo;s centres reaches over two thirds of children in its locality, if we close this one down, repurpose the building as something else (more unaffordable high-rise flat$$$? [like we tried to do with Southall Young Adult Centre, the only youth club in town]), and get our (private) less-qualified and experienced partners to deliver cheaper and less effective children&rsquo;s services in community venues such as the recently repurposed community-centre-as-a-library, churches, mosques, gurdwaras and mandirs, everyone&rsquo;s a winner, right?</p>
<p>I should be a highly paid consultant!</p>
<p>To those of you who actually live in Southall, and who are mostly women (of colour) and have children who have used or use these services now, and who say to me, &ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;. This sounds like cost-cutting. We need more children&rsquo;s centres not fewer. What you&rsquo;re proposing is madness. You&rsquo;re a Labour council, why are you doing this? Many people won&rsquo;t be able to travel half an hour or more on foot or be able to afford public transport to the two remaining centres. Many people won&rsquo;t want to go to the places where they worship and which are highly patriarchal, not known for confidentiality, and not designed for children&rsquo;s safe and secure play and development. The library is too small, and small children like to make a lot of noise and run around. Instead of looking for new exclusionary venues, why not just use the safe and secure, purpose-built inclusive children&rsquo;s centres we already have? Market the services offered in the library and the faith centres&rdquo;: your feedback is valuable and I have no answers. Please fill in the survey and rate my brass neck out of five.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a bit rich coming from the same council who lectured Warren Farm campaigners on the health and wellbeing of Southall&rsquo;s children two short years ago. Local people fought the council&rsquo;s plans to destroy much of the rewilded land at Warren Farm Nature Reserve in order to build new football and cricket pitches on it, and instead wanted to preserve Warren Farm as a nature reserve so that local children living in an otherwise urban environment would have some wildlife and peace and quiet on open land to visit. Meanwhile, the two cricket pitches at Southall Recreation Ground which are used all day every weekend in all weathers are dilapidated and dangerous.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been quite a week.</p>
<p>My Mum has had a rough few years. Eight years ago, aged 71, she lost John (my step-Dad) to cancer. One moment he was fine, the next he started deteriorating rapidly, was soon bedridden, and spent weeks waiting for for death to take him as his body wasted away. Three months and he was gone.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mum sold their beautiful big retirement bungalow she&rsquo;d nursed him in, and got a smaller bungalow in the small town where she&rsquo;d grown up and her cousin still lives and owns the amazing <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/02/my-mums-cousin.html">wool shop</a>.</p>
<p>Two years later she had a mini-stroke, fell and broke her ankle, and had to hand in her driver&rsquo;s licence while she recovered.</p>
<p>Then came COVID-19 and the isolation, followed by misdiagnosed heart failure, and then cancer of her own. She needed major surgery, but the doctors said she wouldn&rsquo;t survive a general anaesthetic (because of the misdiagnosed heart failure).</p>
<p>She prepared to have the surgery with an epidural. On the day of the op, they decided she couldn&rsquo;t have the surgery without a general and so that&rsquo;s what happened. Then there was the radiotherapy and follow up tests every three months since. She survived it all.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then her beloved, very elderly (and very fat) cats died one after another.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been through a lot!</p>
<p>Just before xmas last year she had a chest infection. She&rsquo;s had breathing problems on and off for as long as I can remember. As a kid she said it was bronchitis. Later it was asthma. Now, <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/10/31/copd.html">like me</a>, it&rsquo;s COPD.</p>
<p>She hasn&rsquo;t recovered from this episode and is struggling to do everyday tasks including personal care. Her neighbour has been a godsend throughout and describes my Mum like she&rsquo;s her own mum. I&rsquo;ve been trying to help from a distance (a four hour drive away) to organise home help, etc.</p>
<p>Last Sunday I noticed that my neighbours on the ground floor had a For Sale sign outside their relatively (these days) spacious one bed flat. I messaged my Mum saying it&rsquo;s a shame she can&rsquo;t move in there. Me and my wife could help her with the things she can&rsquo;t do for herself plus keep her company and she gets to see her grandsons in the flesh more than twice a year.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really expect her to take it seriously, but as her helpful and caring neighbour said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a no-brainer.&rdquo; The neighbours downstairs told me that they hadn&rsquo;t decided if they were selling or letting, but today I viewed the flat opposite which, although I&rsquo;d forgotten about it, has been on the market for longer. It&rsquo;s also in good condition, and my neighbour is not in a chain and has somewhere to move to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s given my Mum some hope. It&rsquo;s a big move at her age. Fingers crossed it all works out.</p>

			 <p>Big kid has been learning about WWII at school. He took in a photo of his great grandfather (my Grandpa on my Dad&rsquo;s side).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Grandpa Fred was a coder. He was in the Royal Signal Corps decoding Morse code messages from the Nazis. When war broke he tried to join the Royal Navy. Because he knew Morse code from his job at the Post Office they sent him to Scotland. If he&rsquo;d joined the Atlantic and Arctic conveys he&rsquo;d very likely have ended up at the bottom of the cold, dark sea, and we wouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>As a teenager, I remember spending hours typing in pages of machine code from computer magazines into my Dragon 32 PC hoping not to make a single error and produce a playable game &ldquo;Bomber&rdquo; at the end.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all coding - encoding and decoding - stories that give our lives meaning and purpose.</p>
<p>Weaving our own unique patterns in the fabric of space-time, searching for answers and connections in the world wide web, and gazing at the stars in awe and wonder for millennia.</p>
<p>Using threads from the code of life created by and handed down to us by our ancestors and their ancestors before them since time immemorial.</p>
<p>From cave paintings to fossils and footsteps on the moon, from the Pyramids to the Parthenon and the Pentagon, we&rsquo;re leaving reminders of our existence, building structures that help us to organise, process and understanding information about our world.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re coding large language models and training them on the whole of human knowledge and history hoping that they can tell us the meaning of life and/or not destroy us in the hands of our new Nazi overlords, or serve us up tasteless slop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what Fred would have made of it all. Like my great grandfather <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/25/frank.html">Frank</a> before him, he was from another time, conservative, happy with his lot. He loved Oldham Athletic (&ldquo;Latics&rdquo;), the Telegraph crossword, driving carefully, and Freemasonry. He wrote letters on a typewriter.</p>
<p>He had all his teeth removed at a relatively young age in a &ldquo;buy one get them all removed free&rdquo; kind of <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/02/15/too-good-to-be-true.html">too-good-to-be-true</a> offer, and spent the rest of his days struggling to eat food that wasn&rsquo;t tasteless slop with dentures that never fitted properly. Raw egg mixed with milk and Ribena was a particular favourite, if I remember correctly.</p>

			 <p>I was chatting to one of the other parents at school yesterday morning and mentioned how little kid is totally obsessed with space, all day and every day. It&rsquo;s literally the first thing he talks about when he wakes up, and he falls asleep watching <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/01/21/whats-out-there.html">Brian Cox</a> videos. They had a special space day at school yesterday, too.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>She helpfully suggested visiting the planetarium at Winchester, about an hour&rsquo;s drive away.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought about going anywhere outside of <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/26/looking-at-the.html">London</a>.</p>
<p>Later yesterday afternoon I picked up my guitar for the first time in months, wiped all the dust off it, and strummed the chords to one of my old band&rsquo;s songs, written by the singer who, coincidentally, hails from Winchester.</p>
<p>By evening, I&rsquo;d forgotten all about school mums, planetariums and old mates, and I was more concerned about finishing my <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/02/15/finished-reading-interference-by-brad.html">book</a> and finding out whodunnit?</p>
<p>On page 306 of my book, right in the middle it said (in all CAPS and bold):</p>
<p><strong>WINCHESTER</strong></p>
<p>I checked out the planetarium and ordered four tickets for a nice family outing during half-term .</p>
<p>This morning I told little kid about it and he said he didn&rsquo;t want to go.</p>

			 <p>Last week we had the local cycling group at the school offering free bikes and training to families.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d love free bikes, of course.</p>
<p>Two problems for me, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>There&rsquo;s nowhere safe and secure to keep them.</li>
<li>The roads and drivers around here are downright dangerous, and no dedicated cycle lanes.</li>
</ol>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help myself imparting this information in no uncertain terms to the two smiley elderly ladies handing out the marketing leaflets.</p>
<p>Afterwards, big kid gave me some feedback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, when you shout it makes me want to freeze out of fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;Oh no, sorry, did I shout at those ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t shout at them. You used your political voice. Your political voice makes me want to listen.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Big kid has been on lunch monitor duty at school for the past couple weeks. He enjoys making sure his little bro is all right, and, it turns out, cleaning up all the mess the little kids make. So much so that the headteacher commended him for his efforts.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on the drive to somewhere near enough to school for them to scoot in from, big kid announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, when I&rsquo;m older, I&rsquo;m going to clean up this town!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said it&rsquo;s a big job and suggested he might want to think about starting now, and starting with the streets around the school with some of his friends. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://lagercan.co.uk/outreach-2/">local group</a> who already do just that.</p>
<p>It would be good to get started when the <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/01/17/more-than-two-years-after.html">school street</a> starts next month.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781542020374">Interference</a> by Brad Parks 📚</p>
<p>Read this very quickly (for me), so it&rsquo;s a page-turner and an enjoyable thriller. Quantum entanglement meets murder mystery.</p>
<p>Slightly off-putting when I realised at the end that all the prime suspects were either Chinese, Indian or Egyptian, apart from a couple of white guys who turned out to be wrongly accused and just too damned rich, powerful and clever.</p>

			 <p>Six weeks into my new <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/categories/work/">full-time role at work</a> with the additional two days a week focussed on fundraising for a new youth work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve scoped about 15 potential grant funders, small and large, and submitted 4 applications or pre-applications.</p>
<p>It seems to be grant application season as many of the closing dates are in February and March.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one funder switched their closing date to Thursday last week after previously advertising it as Friday (The Wayback Machine agrees with me). Another closed their online form the day before or on the morning of their published closing date (Friday). Luckily, perhaps, they didn&rsquo;t remove the live application form page I had bookmarked so I could still submit.</p>
<p>It will be annoying if our applications are disregarded in these two cases, although the lesson is don&rsquo;t wait until deadline day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not beating myself up about it. We only had a few days to put something together, and I was chasing/waiting on my boss to draft and agree final wording. It&rsquo;s a learning curve for all of us, and lots we can do better.</p>
<p><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/02/03/spent-the-morning-going-over.html">AI tools</a> were <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/02/07/i-just-used-voicenotescom-on.html">genuinely helpful</a>, and also provided useful feedback on our applications - need to remember to do that step <em>before</em> submitting them next time.</p>

			 <p>This week at school my proud <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/09/16/digital-leader.html">Digital Leader</a> presented a school assembly on the dangers of the internet, and in particular too-good-too-be true offers.</p>
<p>Last night I got a notification that he&rsquo;d spent £8.99 on his Kobo, using his £2 a week pocket money account. Which was odd as I could have sworn he was in bed with his kid brother watching space videos at that moment.</p>
<p>A quick investigation found that last month he&rsquo;d subscribed to a free trial of &ldquo;<strong>READ EVERYTHING YOU WANT!!!</strong>&rdquo; Kobo Plus, and his trial has ended.</p>
<p>We had a little talk and, suitably humbled, I reimbursed his £8.99.</p>

<p>New school street comes into effect next month, so to prepare this morning we parked away from the school and the kids scooted in with me chasing after them on my flat feet.</p>
<p>Need to teach little kid how to use his brake.</p>
<p>Had to pop into the school office to ask for a parents&rsquo; evening form.</p>
<p>Went to Tesco to buy the items that Waitrose couldn&rsquo;t deliver later.</p>
<p>No time for breakfast, instead peeled, chopped and boiled spuds, chopped and fried onions with lentils, prepared carrots and leeks for honey-roasting, cut broccoli florets for steaming, mashed potatoes and spooned on to onions and lentils mixed with gravy and HP sauce in a baking dish, grated Red Leicester to go on top.</p>
<p>Emptied our general waste bin, wet and dry recycling bins, and the food bin.</p>
<p>Unblocked the kitchen sink with the plunger.</p>
<p>Put my laundry away.</p>
<p>Washed up.</p>
<p>Put the groceries away.</p>
<p>Time for a late brunch.</p>

			 <p>I just used Voicenotes.com on my phone to record various training prices from historical invoices reading them off my laptop screen, asked it to create a summary, copied into NotebookLM to sort and make a pretty table I could paste into Sheets, then tidied up the presentation.</p>
<p>Then asked Gemini to research three equivalent types of training from external providers, copied responses into Docs, imported Docs into NotebookLM and got a second shiny table for comparison.</p>

			 <p>This was supposed to be a comprehensive account of events of the last couple of weeks in this corner of the interwebs. Instead, thanks to the events of the last twenty four hours, and on the advice of REDACTED&rsquo;s lawyers, I&rsquo;ve had to make some amendments.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I hope it will help to clear up any misunderstandings and fill in any gaps about what has been going on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of my source material has now been REDACTED, breaking the very fabric of our beloved internet. Forgive me for not taking screenshots.</p>
<h2 id="omg1">OMG!!1!</h2>
<p>The dust has REDACTED, it&rsquo;s all REDACTED over, and it&rsquo;s all REDACTED under the bridge now (or is it?), so what REDACTED time to start REDACTEDing over the muck of the very recent past all over again?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really want to do that, and I held back from saying anything directly at the time, or since, mainly because I didn&rsquo;t feel like there was anything I could add that others hadn&rsquo;t already REDACTED or that wouldn&rsquo;t simply fan the flames of the REDACTED of the REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED that descended from their REDACTED REDACTED horses to demand REDACTED Rotten&rsquo;s evisceration and expulsion from the internets for being a REDACTED-loving REDACTEDphobe.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t want to upset or offend anyone.</p>
<p>But most of all, I didn&rsquo;t want to be on the receiving end of someone else&rsquo;s REDACTED REDACTED.</p>
<p>So out of sheer bloody-minded cowardice and self-preservation I sat back behind the safety of my keyboardless AI slop consumption screen and watched the entirely human generated shitshow go down with an ever increasing sense of unwanted vicarious and voyeuristic unease.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken part in plenty of online arguments and fights over the years (hell, even some real life and in person ones, too), mostly in closed communities, but occasionally in public forums.</p>
<p>My memory isn&rsquo;t what it used to be, but I can&rsquo;t recall there was ever a winner in any of them (and if there was it certainly wasn&rsquo;t me - although it&rsquo;s not the winning that matters, of course, it&rsquo;s the taking part), and no perceivable good has ever come about other than that the flames eventually burn up all the oxygen of publicity and peter out.</p>
<p>Oh, and I hope I have learned that its not worth the emotional toll of getting involved. I learned <a href="https://notes.neatnik.net/2024/01/the-power-to-not">The Power To REDACTED</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also faced unfounded accusations in the workplace.</p>
<p>And I still carry the scars of my REDACTEDs&rsquo; arguments when I was a child.</p>
<p>So all this arguing and accusing evoked in me some difficult emotions and memories.</p>
<h2 id="lol1">LOL!!1!</h2>
<p>As someone who still feels relatively new to REDACTED (after two years), and certainly not feeling part of the already well-established community - I&rsquo;d already been &ldquo;told off&rdquo; by one of the sensible centrist liberal adults for lacking a REDACTED or REDACTED opinion because I drew a metaphorical and frankly dogmatic bloody line in the sand of the ashes of the thousands of murdered children in REDACTED, and planted a tattered REDACTEDbow flag in the rubble opposing the REDACTEDide of REDACTEDinians in REDACTED by REDACTED, and the Good Ol&rsquo; REDACTED of REDACTED&rsquo;s role in funding and arming it - I was aghast to witness the self-declared grown-ups bitching and fighting amongst themselves over who was the fairest of them all.</p>
<p>A few of the most fairest of them all promptly decamped to set up in another part of the world wide web where they will be safe from REDACTEDists and REDACTEDs, and fairytale queens cosplaying as old ladies bearing poison apples.</p>
<p>Speaking of apples, it was First Man REDACTED who ate the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and brought about the Fall of Man. First Man REDACTED, and First REDACTED Eve, lost their innocence and became ashamed of their nakedness. Their sinful obsession with REDACTED made them the world&rsquo;s first REDACTEDs.</p>
<p>Led by judge, jury and executioner in-chief First Man REDACTED, the REDACTEDers had decided that REDACTED Rotten&rsquo;s use six months previously of &ldquo;REDACTED&rdquo; was non-binary and cast-iron proof that REDACTED is, in fact, REDACTEDphobic, and that cannot be tolerated - or at least, it cannot be tolerated six months down the line when First Man REDACTED, who wasn&rsquo;t cyberstalking REDACTED Rotten at all, just happened to notice that REDACTED had paid for a subscription to REDACTED&rsquo;s newly unelected REDACTEDist henchman REDACTED&rsquo;s REDACTED.com.</p>
<p>Not only was he a fully paid up member of the REDACTED billionaire&rsquo;s despised social network, REDACTED had publicly praised REDACTED&rsquo;s REDACTED exploration ambitions and his REDACTED cars!</p>
<p>As if this wasn&rsquo;t REDACTED enough on its own, REDACTED was named as a REDACTED of the REDACTED indieweb REDACTED social network REDACTED, set up several years ago as a community-minded alternative to the toxic REDACTED by the ever so manly monikered REDACTED.</p>
<p>&ldquo;HOW COULD MANLY MONIKERED REDACTED EMPLOY REDACTED-LOVING REDACTEDPHOBE REDACTED ROTTEN?!!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;MANLY MONIKERED REDACTED MUST IMMEDIATELY &ldquo;PRONOUNCE&rdquo; HIS PERSONAL ALLYSHIP WITH TEH REDACTED COMMUNITAH!!1!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;REDACTED MY AUTHORITAH!!1!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="fafo1">FAFO!!1!</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I think REDACTED could and should be more careful with his REDACTED utterances, particularly in his role as a REDACTED of his own REDACTED, which I presume he welcomes anyone and everyone to use, contribute to and subscribe to. It does look bad that he&rsquo;s also a REDACTED REDACTED, and paying REDACTED to use REDACTED, AND praising REDACTED (especially in light of REDACTED&rsquo;s overt REDACTED salutes).</p>
<p>But in my humble, unwanted and irrelevant white middle-REDACTED male REDACTED-gendered opinion, none of that defines him as a REDACTED-lover or a REDACTEDphobe. I mean, he could be both, or one or the other, or neither. I don&rsquo;t know. I think it&rsquo;s disingenuous to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>That said, it doesn&rsquo;t mean people can&rsquo;t be offended by any or all of it six months ago, two weeks ago, now and forever more. In REDACTED&rsquo;s defence, it seems like he did make some kind of apology at the time even if it wasn&rsquo;t good enough, and it was compounded by his publishing of later REDACTED posts complaining about being &lsquo;REDACTED&rsquo;.</p>
<p>REDACTED, a REDACTED REDACTED who did take offence at REDACTED&rsquo;s &ldquo;REDACTED&rdquo; comment REDACTED her subscription to REDACTED&rsquo;s REDACTED service, and REDACTED about her REDACTED. REDACTED REDACTED her in full, and while it shouldn&rsquo;t have REDACTED, could have been REDACTED much better, and undoubtedly left a very REDACTED REDACTED in the mouth for REDACTED, First Man REDACTED and plenty of others, that really should have been the end of it.</p>
<p>As others have REDACTED better than me, it does appear as if First Man REDACTED had it in for REDACTED and saw REDACTED&rsquo;s blue REDACTED account and his praise of REDACTED as an opportunity to exert some kind of REDACTED or &ldquo;REDACTED&rdquo; upon him. While I&rsquo;m not suggesting REDACTED set out to invoke the REDACTED REDACTED, he knows as well as anyone what it&rsquo;s all about and The Power To REDACTED get involved in other people&rsquo;s battles.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s somewhat ironic, if no less unpleasant, that in seeking to give up his Power to REDACTED in order to REDACTED the internet, he has now had to REDACTED his REDACTED REDACTED in the face of REDACTED REDACTED.</p>

			 <p>Last weekend I was discovering the joy of listening to Leeds-based band <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/01/23/on-sunday-i-was-listening.html">English Teacher</a>, whose singer Lily Fontaine hails from Colne, near Pendle, in Lancashire.</p>
<p>This weekend I&rsquo;ve been rediscovering the joy of listening to Leeds-based band <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2025/01/31/its-been-a-chumbawamba-sort.html">Chumbawamba</a>, whose singer Alice Nutter hails from Burnley, near Pendle, in Lancashire.</p>
<p>One of English Teacher&rsquo;s songs &ldquo;The World&rsquo;s Biggest Paving Slab&rdquo; references the Pendle Witch Trials.</p>
<p>Alice Nutter, of course, was the name of one of the Pendle witches, and Chumbawamba&rsquo;s Alice Nutter went on to write a play about the Witch Trials.</p>

<p>I forgot all about, so just folded over the edge at the last moment before it went in the oven. It&rsquo;s delicious, but looks and feels more like a pie, and no. 1 son didn&rsquo;t like it at all!</p>

			 <p>Talking of Chumbawamba has sent me down another memory hole today.</p>
<p>I have some hazy memories of following another anti-fascist band, Blaggers ITA, around in the early &rsquo;90s. I seem to remember playing football with them in Manchester at one time. That was after the pub closed on a hot Sunday afternoon to kill some time before their gig in the evening.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the echoes of the goat singer’s song,<br>
where Dionysus whispers through the vines,<br>
we find ourselves entwined in ancient rites -<br>
fertility rituals of death and rebirth,<br>
of new life and new wine.</p>
<p>Here, survival is the meaning of everything:<br>
the stars beyond our reach, the earth beneath our feet.<br>
Good versus evil, truth versus lies,<br>
blame and luck, conspiracies and fate.<br>
Destiny waits like a vulture on the tiles,<br>
and bad choices remind us,<br>
Of the arrogance leading us down paths we can’t retrace.</p>
<p>We are always wanting more -<br>
more wine, more power, more love, more life.<br>
But injustice follows us like a shadow,<br>
inescapable, irretrievable, inevitable.<br>
“You paid a price to come this far,”<br>
As if suffering were currency,<br>
as if pain could buy redemption.</p>
<p>Euripides knew it well:<br>
the gods are not just.<br>
They play with mortals like toys,<br>
throwing dice with our fates,<br>
laughing at our despair.<br>
Moral ambiguity reigns supreme,<br>
and protest is futile,<br>
a scream into the void that answers only with silence.<br>
Cynicism grows like weeds in the cracks of our souls,<br>
but still, there is hope -<br>
a flicker, a spark,<br>
a stubborn refusal to give in to the darkness.</p>
<p>Diatribe becomes spectacle,<br>
entertainment for the masses,<br>
as we watch our own downfall unfold<br>
like actors in a play we didn’t write.<br>
Insanity creeps in,<br>
whispering in our ears,<br>
telling us we’re not good enough,<br>
that we’ll never be good enough.<br>
And maybe that’s true.<br>
Maybe we are all doomed to fail,<br>
to fall,<br>
to lose everything.</p>
<p>Desertion, rejection, loss -<br>
the Fall of Man,<br>
the absence of God.<br>
We cry out, but no one answers.<br>
We reach out, but no one takes our hand.<br>
Tragedy guaranteed,<br>
but still, we’re alive.<br>
Apart from the ones who aren’t.<br>
Now there’s the real tragedy -<br>
the ones who didn’t make it,<br>
who didn’t survive the journey,<br>
who didn’t pay the price,<br>
or who paid too much.</p>
<p>Suffering is knowledge,<br>
the bitter fruit of humanity.<br>
We taste it every day,<br>
in every breath,<br>
in every tear.<br>
But even in the darkest moments,<br>
there is light -<br>
a glimmer of something beyond the suffering,<br>
beyond the pain.<br>
A hope that refuses to die,<br>
a faith that clings to the edge of reason,<br>
a belief that maybe, just maybe,<br>
we are more than the sum of our broken hearts.</p>
<p>And so we keep moving,<br>
through the desert,<br>
through the wasteland,<br>
through the ruins of our shattered dreams.<br>
Because even though the road is long—
or there is no road and we have to find our own way -
we are still here.<br>
We are still alive.<br>
And that, in itself, is enough.</p>

			 <p>&lsquo;The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says the building was targeted because it was a Hezbollah &ldquo;terrorist command centre&rdquo; and it &ldquo;eliminated&rdquo; a Hezbollah commander. It added that &ldquo;the overwhelming majority&rdquo; of those killed in the strike were &ldquo;confirmed to be terror operatives&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But a BBC Eye investigation verified the identity of 68 of the 73 people killed in the attack and uncovered evidence suggesting just six were linked to Hezbollah&rsquo;s military wing. None of those we identified appeared to hold a senior rank. The BBC&rsquo;s World Service also found that the other 62 were civilians - 23 of them children.&rsquo;</p>

			 <p>On Sunday I was listening to Lianne La Havas&rsquo; COLORS rendition of &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/_YOvQNgpfXY">Bittersweet</a>&rdquo; on YouTube.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re picking that fight everyday<br>
This shit’s going nowhere</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Algorithm did its job well and showed me the latest KEXP concert by a new to me band called <a href="https://youtu.be/Qeo4GZMe-FE">English Teacher</a>. I was blown away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve seen more COLORS Shows than KEXPs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit prog at times, and a lot music studenty, but they can really play so that&rsquo;s all forgiven, especially if you listen to the interview with the band at the end of the full concert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/OPm0hwBbtnI">Albert Road</a>&rdquo; is possibly my favourite, although I think the recorded version is even better and more poignant with the video (especially in light of the drama of the last couple of days):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Steve&rsquo;s mate&rsquo;s son used to play in The Fall&hellip;)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So don&rsquo;t take our prejudice to heart<br>
We hate everyone<br>
The world around us never showed<br>
How loving can be fun</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than The Fall, they somehow remind me of The Sugarcubes, who I loved back in the late 80s, but who I haven&rsquo;t listened to properly for a long time. I listened to the album &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s Too Good&rdquo; this afternoon while working, and it was better than I remember it. &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/fq2dWTBVZD4">Deus</a>&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He put me in a bath tub<br>
Made me squeaky clean</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently Bjork&rsquo;s producer produced English Teacher&rsquo;s album.</p>
<p>More reminiscent of The Fall (and Frank Sidebottom), perhaps, is their song (and video) about the singer&rsquo;s smalltown hometown of Colne in Lancashire and its inflated egos, &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/YNkbgumvYyA">The World&rsquo;s Biggest Paving Slab</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the world&rsquo;s biggest paving slab<br>
So watch your fucking feet</p>
</blockquote>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>What&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My space-obsessed four and three quarter year old might ask me that soon, so I better have an answer.</p>
<p>At the moment he&rsquo;s happy to copy his ten and a half year old brother and stick with &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in Uranus?&rdquo; for laughs. (Although he does actually want to know what&rsquo;s in Uranus, too.)</p>
<p>Recently, I have been replaced by Professor Brian Cox on bedtime story reading duties.</p>
<p>Instead of me reading simple kids&rsquo; books on space until he falls asleep, Prof. Cox narrates stories on YouTube about black holes, space-time elasticity and Fermi&rsquo;s Paradox. It&rsquo;s fascinating, and sends the little one off to sleep at least as efficiently as me reading to him.</p>
<p>I admit that while I was aware of Fermi&rsquo;s Paradox, I hadn&rsquo;t quite cottoned on to its significance.</p>
<p>That, in answer the the question &ldquo;What&rsquo;s out there?&rdquo; there&rsquo;s an unimaginably vast number of planets, stars, galaxies, etc., in an even more unimaginably vast and mostly empty space. And in spite of this vastness, there&rsquo;s absolutely zero evidence (so far) of any kind of life at all other than here on our tiny, tiny speck of Earth. We&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>Echoing Carl Sagan, Prof. Cox was quite poetic about it and described it as the Universe taking millions of years to come up with just the right conditions for an unbroken chain of evolutionary life to emerge that has an awareness of itself.</p>
<p>And that the Universe is a frighteningly violent place so it&rsquo;s quite miraculous that we haven&rsquo;t (yet) been smashed or fried in some astronomical event. In fact, we look odds-on to smash or fry ourselves first right here, right now.</p>
<p>Our evolutionarily advantageous over-confidence will inevitably lead us to self-destruction, as surely as boom leads to bust, as we ignore climate warnings from our wise elders, wage war on our brothers and our sisters, and repeatedly fail to think of the children.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re wedded to screens and technology as life passes us by. Doom-scribing, scrolling and trolling, when we should be out there talking to our neighbours, being the change we want to see in the &lsquo;hood, and showing some fucking solidarity with each other. We&rsquo;re not all perfect, we can all say and do the wrong things, even hold the wrong beliefs.</p>
<p>Identity politics has much to answer for, but the answer isn&rsquo;t to dismiss people&rsquo;s lived experiences. Each to their own, and everyone must be able to live their lives as they want to while not harming others. But when someone expresses themselves in ways that cause hurt or offense, piling on and ostracising them often just deepens divisions.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to find ways to acknowledge everyone&rsquo;s feelings and guide each other toward mutual understanding. This isn&rsquo;t easy, especially online, but it&rsquo;s essential if we want to build real solidarity.</p>
<p>Because the point is that the people who want to colonize Mars, or make &ldquo;their&rdquo; country great again, or spend billions on war when our elders are dying in hospital corridors, are not on our side. If we could find ways to stick together, however we identify as individuals, we could challenge these concentrations of power and wealth.</p>
<p>I feel certain that if everyone had a decent home with enough food, meaningful and/or well paid work, and enough free time to pursue leisure interests with friends and family, then very few people would give a flying fuck about what pronouns people prefer, or if someone moved from one &ldquo;country&rdquo; to &ldquo;another&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe then we can leave a planet that&rsquo;s still inhabitable for our children.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s also possible that we are not alone. It&rsquo;s possible that aliens are among us, badly disguised as awkward, orange humans, or <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/davidmarsden/85546013707/aleister-crowley-aliens-owls-and-jesus?source=share">owls</a>, or neutrinos.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I keep reading that AI is dumb, dangerous and demented. And I&rsquo;ve no doubt it&rsquo;s all true. Ethan Mollick, author of Co-Intelligence, describes ChatGPT as &ldquo;<a href="https://ericgregorich.blog/2025/01/10/ultimately-that-is-all-chatgpt.html">a very elaborate auto complete like you have on your phone</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>AI slop is contaminating our lives with worthless junk, and while I&rsquo;ve played with and been briefly amazed and entertained by Google NotebookLM&rsquo;s auto-generated <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/10/29/the-southall-gasworks.html">podcast creations</a>, they can get repetitive, boring and stupid very quickly.</p>
<p>We can rail against AI all we want, but it&rsquo;s not going away. I expect AI to get smarter and to have fewer hallucinations even if the danger level remains high.</p>
<p>What is Al good for?</p>
<p>Micro.blog uses Al to generate Alt-Text descriptions of images and that seems to work well enough for its intended purpose. What it can&rsquo;t do, of course, is generate descriptions that are personal to the uploader or post context, e.g., if I have a picture of my son the description will be a generic &ldquo;boy with curly hair&rdquo; or such like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used Google&rsquo;s Gemini on blog posts I&rsquo;ve written and it&rsquo;s given me some very positive feedback about my writing, enough to make me feel good about myself (certainly much more so than any human reader). Although it also got into the habit of creating its own alternative versions, which often were funnier and more interesting (to me) than my own writing. (It will also roast you if that&rsquo;s your thing.)</p>
<p>Similarly, Google NotebookLM has fed back on my entire year of posts in 2024, and was very nice about it, too. It is quite therapeutic to hear that, as long as you take it for what it is - an elaborate auto-complete that ultimately will rot your brain, take your job and ruin your life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also used both for work in some limited ways - drafting a job description, drafting cases for support for funding applications, and summarising or analysing documents. Both require some degree of human intervention, but the process and product was useful in helping me get started, and complete the tasks.</p>
<p>One area where I found Al to be most interesting was in commenting on and forming an ethical response to <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/04/30/i-am-the.html">a local democracy issue</a> where I live. I found the response to be in line with what community campaigners (including me) had been asking for, and in total contrast to the response from our elected representatives, authorities and business leaders. That must be the auto-complete.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t think I would yet call for all <a href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/ai-for-public-good/will-ai-replace-policymakers">politicians to be replaced by AI</a>, I do wonder if there is a potential use case here for analysing policy implications, or at least highlighting ethical considerations?</p>
<p>I ran these thoughts past Claude.ai and this is a summary of what it had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>democratic processes need human judgment, accountability, and the ability to balance competing interests the ways that AI currently cannot</li>
<li>core ethical principles that should guide public service:</li>
<li>transparency about conflicts of interest</li>
<li>accountability to the people</li>
<li>clear acknowledgment of problems rather than minimisation</li>
<li>practical solutions for reporting complaints and response</li>
<li>the fundamental duty of public officials to serve their constituents</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Human decision-makers can, of course, choose to prioritise other interests over ethical imperatives</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suggested to it that the AI response to the Southall Gasworks issue demonstrated more &ldquo;empathy&rdquo; than the human political response:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The AI&rsquo;s response prioritised human wellbeing and acknowledged suffering, in contrast to the actual political response, which was bureaucratic and dismissive, treating hundreds of complaints as isolated incidents and prioritising procedural responses over human impact</li>
<li>A truly empathetic human response to such serious health impacts should have been immediate and decisive action to protect public health</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the AI response wasn&rsquo;t actually empathetic. It applied logical ethical principles that prioritise human wellbeing. What looks like empathy is actually systematic ethical reasoning unclouded by personal interests, political considerations, or institutional self-protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suggested that it might not be uncommon for political leaders to lack empathy, and that it&rsquo;s therefore so much easier for them to allow personal, and powerful political and institutional interests to take precedence over what most ordinary people would see quite clearly as the interests of human wellbeing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This connects to research on the prevalence of psychopathic traits in leadership positions. In the Southall Gasworks case, a leader with normal empathetic capacity might find it psychologically difficult to:</p>
<ul>
<li>dismiss hundreds of health complaints from suffering residents</li>
<li>accept substantial gifts while community members develop serious illnesses</li>
<li>continue business as usual while learning of deaths potentially linked to their decision</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, even someone with empathy might not be able to resist powerful institutional or financial pressures.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>1-1 at full-time*.</p>
<p>The two managers presumably threw cups and plates around in their half-time team talks and both teams came out into the second half looking determined to make a game of it.</p>
<p>Bruno scored a fantastic goal on the counter-attack to put United ahead and everything was going to plan. It was the United of old.</p>
<p>For some reason Dalot then decided to try to break his opponents legs and duly received a second yellow card and took an early bath.</p>
<p>For some reason United&rsquo;s reserve goalkeeper Bayindir decided to play as erratically as United&rsquo;s first choice goalkeeper and weakly punched a cross he might have caught into the path of an opponent in his own penalty area and Arsenal equalised with a deflection off the hapless de Ligt.</p>
<p>Then the fun really started.</p>
<p>Maguire put his arm out to stop his opponent who was in the process of dancing past him. Fair enough he went down like he&rsquo;d been hit by a left hook - even my wife laughed at how pathetic it was. The ref rightly awarded a penalty and Maguire led a group rendition of &ldquo;Handbags at Dawn&rdquo;. A couple of players went down as if they&rsquo;d been headbutted, but they soon got up again when they heard everyone laughing at them.</p>
<p>There was another dramatic turn as Arsenal were about to take the lead when Bayindir produced a miraculous save from the penalty.</p>
<p>Raheem Sterling looked on with some seriously impressive sideburns.</p>
<p>There was lots of end to end stuff after that but I missed most of it making big kid&rsquo;s tea.</p>
<p>*Extra time will now be played.</p>

			 <p>0-0 at The Emirates at halftime in the FA Cup.</p>
<p>For some reason Arsenal are dressed as Leeds in the 1970s. United are dressed as United in the 1968 European Cup Final. They&rsquo;re playing with a golden ball in memory of David Beckham.</p>
<p>United&rsquo;s Harry Maguire produced the most memorable moment of the first half as he nutmegged himself while delicately backheeling an assist for Martinelli to score for Arsenal.</p>
<p>For some reason the goal was disallowed for offside.</p>
<p>Kobbie Mainoo hasn&rsquo;t scored for United since he scored in United&rsquo;s win in the final last year, and he hasn&rsquo;t scored today either.</p>

<p>All it made me feel was like I needed to pee every half an hour.</p>
<p>At least it upped my step count and gave my kidneys a work out.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The last time I worked full-time, in 2015, I got fired for taking too much time off sick.</p>
<p>The last time I worked full time before that, in 2011, I got fried for taking too much time off sick.</p>
<p>So I was quite happy to work part-time since 2016, fifteen hours a week to begin with, increasing to twenty two and a half hours in 2017. It felt like something I could cope with.</p>
<p>And it allowed me to spend a lot of time with big kid when he was little, and then little kid, too. Although that was often tiring &lsquo;work&rsquo; I feel very fortunate to have had that much time with them when they were so young and fun.</p>
<p>Working two or three days a week and really being in charge of my own hours and schedule also allowed me lots of flexibility. I could almost work when I liked and didn&rsquo;t worry about how many hours I&rsquo;d done. If I needed to I could easily make up time or catch up on another day.</p>
<p>Going back full-time today, I was very conscious of how much time I spent working, and not working. I&rsquo;ve got much less flexibility now to make up my hours.</p>
<p>Then again, I know that at work, it&rsquo;s possible to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, the bathroom, the hallway, and the office not actually doing much work. I won&rsquo;t be too hard on myself for making a cup of tea, powdering my nose, connecting the wife to the internet or checking my online socials every now and then.</p>
<p>All in all it wasn&rsquo;t a bad day. Nothing urgent to do and I ended up going down a fundraising rabbit-hole. Found a couple of new-to-me funders and shared them with the relevant people, one of whom has already said they will apply.</p>
<p>Job done.</p>

			 <p>2-2 in the end after an exciting second half of end-to-end football. United played like a team transformed in confidence and belief. They scored first, and didn&rsquo;t wilt completely after Liverpool equalised and then went ahead after a VAR penalty decision (technically correct, blah, blah, blah) over-ruled the ref&rsquo;s &ldquo;clear and obvious error&rdquo; in waving play on. They grabbed an equaliser themselves and should have won it at the death, but Zirkzee (probably lacking in confidence after being subbed in the first half against Newcastle) chose to pass to Maguire rather than shoot. Maguire shinned it over the bar.</p>

			 <p>This year I&rsquo;m returning to full-time work for the first time in almost a decade. I&rsquo;m looking forward to it, though, and my main focus is going to be on researching and writing grant funding applications for local community youth work.</p>
<p>Last term I joined my sons&rsquo; school&rsquo;s parent teacher association specifically to help find grant funding they can apply for. I need to get on with that.</p>
<p>I also hope to be able to get more involved (again) in local democracy and activism in person. I&rsquo;d like to see if we can get some kind of organised mutual aid and self-help community going.</p>
<p>I want to get fitter and lose some weight, so I&rsquo;m intend to walk every morning (flat feet permitting) and I&rsquo;m no longer taking sugar in tea and coffee.</p>
<p>I want to sleep better (which is partly dependent on little kid staying in his own bed all night), breathe better, and get my psoriasis under control.</p>
<p>And I want a new hat.</p>

			 <p>The old house was long and thin, with dark corridors that ran from one end to the other, beside narrow rooms and cold passages, a front room, a dining room, a living room and a kitchen. Upstairs were four bedrooms with a bathroom in the middle, the wooden floorboards boomed and creaked with every step. I lay in the back room above the garden that grew wild, so cold and lonely, but sleep took me away as she did every night.</p>
<p>The screaming woke me.</p>
<p>The voice was sobbing, weeping, crying out for help, filling me with its fear, its sobs and cries, as footsteps urgently pounded the way to my sanctuary, beating on the door, &ldquo;Help me! Help me! Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to move, I wanted to help, to say something, anything, but my hands were tied, I was strapped to the bed and gagged, I couldn&rsquo;t move or speak.</p>
<p>Christ I could barely breathe as the door opened, the screaming stopped and the small dark figure entered and came over to me. It&rsquo;s breath was loud, shallow and hoarse.</p>
<p>Now I started to make a sound. A pathetic, frightened, cowardly whimper, as the figure climbed on top of me and sat on my chest. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I looked at its face&hellip;</p>
<p>I woke with my heart beating its way out of my chest as the footsteps pounded away down the hallway, taking the sobbing voice with them, as I dried the tears from my cheeks, my mouth dry, and tried to unsee the face that woke me, that saved me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I love music. Who doesn&rsquo;t? I guess there must be some people. I was one of them.</p>
<p>I stopped loving music when I was too busy feeling miserable to love music or anything else. I stopped loving music when I converted from the warmth and intimacy of vinyl and mix-tapes to the colder and harder to get close to CDs, and later mp3s. The difference between analogue and digital. I do miss my old records.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I started loving music again when I started feeling better. I started loving music again when I started investing in better listening gear and lossless digital recordings. I&rsquo;m no audiophile, but it makes a big difference, even (or perhaps especially) to my untrained and unbalanced partially deaf ears. And I honestly don&rsquo;t miss my old CDs.</p>
<p>How do I listen to music now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a massive pair of old Jamo Gale Force 25 (or 35?) speakers, which I must have bought nearly thirty years ago. Back then they were used as mini-PA speakers in my old band&rsquo;s rehearsal room.</p>
<p>Since then they&rsquo;ve provided a heavy bass and mid-range sound for music and TV connected through my Sony amplifier (much, much better sound than my previous Marantz and Cambridge Audio amps). I added a pair of smaller QAcoustics top speakers to these a few years ago, which noticeably (and unsurprisingly) improved the top end and overall sound.</p>
<p>Although I could stream from my phone via the Bluetooth link on the amp, this year I acquired a Tempotec Serenade X music streaming device, which does the same, but with a built-in DAC (digital to analogue converter). It makes a massive sound difference, even at a relatively low cost (these things can cost hundreds if not thousands).</p>
<p>Plus it can connect via ethernet cable to hi-res streaming services Tidal or Qobuz, and play my entire lossless digital music collection via a connected micro-SD card.</p>
<p>All of that said, it&rsquo;s not often I get to listen to my music without using headphones. My little kid used to love watching the psychedelic videos of The Beatles and The Stones on YouTube, as well as <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/search/?q=tiny+desk">some Tiny Desk concerts</a>, but that all stopped when he quit daytime naps when he turned four and discovered <em>YouTube Kids</em> and how to operate the TV remote control.</p>
<p>For years I had a pair of cheap Sennheiser headphones, which were decent enough for listening to mp3s via my laptop. In 2018 I got a Dragonfly Black DAC that plugs into my laptop via USB. The difference in sound quality was astonishing.</p>
<p>Later that year I bought a Fiio M7 DAC music player, and again the transformation of sound was literally music to my ears.</p>
<p>This year I got a Tempotec V3 (cheapish, but still an upgrade), and been through wireless Iris Flow ListenWell and wired Bayerdynamic DT 770 Pro Studio headphones, before this year treating myself to a pair of massively discounted wired Focal Elegia &lsquo;phones. Each one offers a different sound. The key being that they make listening to music an aural pleasure again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also got some cheapish EarFun in-ear buds (a big upgrade on Pixel buds) for a quick wireless listen and an EarFun dongle DAC to plugin to my headphones and phone or laptop as an upgrade on my Dragonfly.</p>
<p>Big kid now has my Fiio M7 and Iris Flow headphones and loves listening to The Beatles, as well as my old band <a href="https://www.bandlab.com/davidmarsden/albums/e3c6b0ef-d188-ef11-8471-000d3a930775">Hovercraft</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Let&rsquo;s get something out of the way before we get into the meat, or the filling, of this post. A sandwich is <strong>two slices</strong> of bread. Buttered.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hear anything about OPEN sandwiches. Open sandwiches are like open marriages. Great if you want someone else to have your other half.</p>
<p>The art of a good sandwich:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use multiple fillings. Four is a good number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less is more. Don&rsquo;t over egg it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, tonight I cleared out some leftovers and turned them into a great sandwich: two slices of ham, half an avocado (sliced), three cherry tomatoes (quartered), a squirt of mayonnaise, chopped dried chives and three or four spoons of sweet and hot jalapenos out of a jar.</p>
<p>Many times I&rsquo;ve got halfway through a &ldquo;classic&rdquo; cheese and tomato sandwich and thought &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too cheesy.&rdquo; A squirt of mayo and a sprinkling of chives world have saved it. Some of that jalapeno magic would have made it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I&rsquo;m not against sandwiches with fewer than four fillings. When I was recovering from Covid, all I could eat was cheese and pickle sandwiches. I like a jam sandwich occasionally. And if it&rsquo;s a crust, I&rsquo;ll even eat it in an &ldquo;open&rdquo; jam sandwich (or bread and jam as we call it).</p>
<p>Which brings me on to toast. Toast and marmalade is not a sandwich. Cheese on toast is not a sandwich. Avocado toast is not a sandwich. But two rounds of toast with a filling inside IS a toasted sandwich. (See how simple this is?)</p>
<p>Now, with toasted sandwiches I would advocate sticking to one or two fillings. (Melted) cheese is always a winner with the kids. Grown-ups might like to add some chopped ham, onions or mushrooms. My little kid&rsquo;s current favourite is &ldquo;honey toast&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>This was survey feedback given to developers proposing to build a massive data centre on the site of the industrial estate down the road from me, but it applies more broadly to all big developers, especially those with annual profits of half a billion pounds.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned about noise from the site causing a nuisance and health problems in an area that is already susceptible to multiple environmental health stressors, and exacerbated by deep-rooted poverty, deprivation, low pay and systemic racism and power imbalances embedded in the local authority planning system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also concerned about the local power grid. Only a couple of years ago it was reported that Ealing doesn&rsquo;t have enough capacity to power more new homes that are so badly needed, particularly in Southall which suffers from chronic overcrowding. A data centre requires a lot of power. How will this work?</p>
<p>If you really want to do something for the local community how about you plant thousands of trees to compensate for the fact that Southall has the lowest tree canopy cover in the whole of Ealing?</p>
<p>How about building homes for the street homeless and providing ongoing support they will need to live in them sustainably?</p>
<p>How about building a drug and alcohol rehab unit to treat the ever growing numbers of addicts roaming our streets and parks?</p>
<p>How about using all that information processing power to work out how to provide more frequent, more reliable, free public transport in Southall and to reduce the congestion caused by all the traffic?</p>
<p>How about building a secular community centre, a library, a youth club, a health centre, a school? Southall is so overdeveloped now, and Ealing Labour Council sold off all our community assets to developers.</p>

			 <p>We watched Wallace and Gromit this afternoon, which everyone enjoyed, little kid was particularly excited.</p>
<p>After that, despite protests from the kids, I watched United at lowly Wolves. I&rsquo;d been convinced beforehand that this was a game the new Portuguese manager must surely win. At half-time it was 0-0 and I thought it was hard to see either team scoring (or not conceding).</p>
<p>Within a couple of minutes of the restart Bruno stupidly got himself sent off for fouling the Wolves right back in the Wolves&rsquo; half. Needless, and it left the ten men looking bereft without their leader, talisman, only creative outlet and most likely goal threat.</p>
<p>Wolves soon capitalised and deservedly went ahead. I thought United looked a little better when Casemiro and Eriksen replaced the ineffectual Mainoo and Ugarte in central midfield late on, but even then United looked like they did under Ten Hag - lost.</p>
<p>Yes, we can see what the new manager is trying to do. 3-4-2-1. But it doesn&rsquo;t work, for whatever reasons. And like Ten Hag, he has no Plan B. Can he have lost the dressing room already? He seems to have alienated Rashford and Casemiro, and while both have their faults, both could be important players, too. Their replacements are worse.</p>
<p>Wolves scored a second with virtually the last kick of the game, and their new Portuguese manager recorded his second win in two games playing 3-4-2-1.</p>
<p>In my opinion, United should be playing a counter-attacking 4-3-3 and playing to our strengths (fast wingers), which would secure our perennial weakness (central midfield), and protect our defence. Instead we&rsquo;re playing a new system, which no one seems to understand and that seems to play to no one&rsquo;s strengths.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe we just need more patience and in another ten games it will all look different. Or we could be looking over our shoulders at the bottom three.</p>

			 <p>I had a lot fun writing and publishing on micro.blog this year, and also looking back and picking out these (for me) highlights.</p>
<p>I started the year with the final (so far) part of my <em><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/01/24/curriculum-vitae-memento.html">curriculum vitae</a></em> series. The one where I found my dream job:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no welcome&hellip; it stank of piss. The only redeeming factor was that none of the inmates seemed able to move.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The beauty of the whole endeavour was that people needing care were no longer seen as tasks to be performed and checked off on a list, but as people who had lives, stories, senses of humour, wants and needs like everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such a great thing could obviously have no future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the power of <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/02/07/last-words.html">writing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having an hour or so in relatively undisturbed peace and quiet just to write whatever comes into my head has felt very therapeutic. I feel like something significant has changed within me, for the better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/03/15/journaling.html">journaling</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Journaling is like legacy microblogging minus the passive aggressive bullshit and wit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the power of <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/04/25/a-trip-down.html">memory</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing was where Jim remembered it. Like his hat, they were very much alive in Jim&rsquo;s memory, but in the world we walked in the goalposts had literally moved, the final whistle had blown, and everyone had gone home except Jim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/05/09/fear-and-loathing.html">travelling abroad</a> for the first time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It all felt utterly surreal to me then, like being stranded on another planet, adrift in my bunk bed, alone in the halls of a spacecraft listening to the crickets and the ghostly sounds of train hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/05/19/the-cuckoos-nest.html">local democracy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The event itself was a repeat of several resident surveys and failed plans over the past twenty years or so. The problems are always the same. The responses from the council are always the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/07/04/election-fever.html">my four year old&rsquo;s analysis of the state of British politics</a> after the results of the May General Election:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can clearly see the Labour supermajority in red, and the Tory wipeout in blue. That they are two cheeks of the same backside is encapsulated in the red triangle atop the blue square in the centre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the state of <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/09/07/funny-old-game.html">our national game</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nowadays managers - or coaches - are often restricted to, well, coaching players in training and on match days, and speaking to the media before and after games. They are seen as specialists rather than all-rounders, and more specialists from the world of finance are brought in to fire the tea ladies&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/10/27/clear-and-obvious.html">United under Ten Hag</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A clear and obvious error, if ever there was one, and yet we are forced to watch repeat after repeat, week after week of him getting it wrong. A bald man somehow getting balder&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/12/ive-worked-from.html">working from home</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working from home has given me the time and space to transform how I work for the better. I&rsquo;m better organised, more thoughtful, less rushed and distracted. I can honestly say that I&rsquo;m now the most productive I&rsquo;ve ever been thanks to a more comfortable, relaxed and focussed personal workspace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/15/blessed-are-the.html">cheese</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Double Gloucester. Trump-like appearance, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not a vote-winner. Biden-like quality: good all-rounder, mild, creamy, child-friendly, goes with most things, melts easily. Oily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the death-grip of <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/19/people-dont-change.html">neoliberalism</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neoliberalism doesn&rsquo;t change, and the more that the people are subjected to its bad decisions, its lust for war, for death, for oil, for money, for making the rich richer and the poor poorer, the harder it gets for people to change, and the fewer good decisions are made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <em><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/19/got-carter.html">Person Of Interest</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you like guns, shooting people, torture, (mock) executions, (child) kidnapping, (attempted) murder, blackmail, gambling, Russian Roulette, cyber-stalking, identity theft, mob rule and police corruption, you&rsquo;ll probably like <em>Person of Interest</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Lincolnshire <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/21/sausages.html">sausages</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A special treat then was boiled sausages for breakfast. The skins would fall off, and we ate them with white bread soaked in the soup or broth they created in the pan along with a dash of English mustard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On living and breathing <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/23/living-and-breathing.html">music</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to love such amazing musicianship, singing and songs, all performed with unconfined joy in the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do wonder if sometimes songs speak to me even when I&rsquo;m not actively listening? When I do pay attention to the words they do carry meaning for me. They just needed to be heard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/23/on-journaling.html">journaling</a> (again):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing this work has made sense of a lot of daily, weekly and monthly events, habits, routines, scenarios, relationships, that otherwise would have remained loosely connected, strung together like the Christmas tree lights every year when you take them out of the box you left them in in January. In a mess, tangled up, half-working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/29/the-recent-farmers.html">the bales</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My fingertips took several days to regrow. I had fifty pence deducted from my wages for the cost of replenishing the first aid kit, and received a straight knockout for bleeding on the ropes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/12/04/i-was-in.html">writing</a> (again):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I write for me. It helps me breathe and to feel alive.</p>

			 <p>Some people seem to find the idea of machine intelligence frightening. And with good reason. Because from where I&rsquo;m sitting at the breakfast table, the machines around me are mostly dumber than a rock (although that&rsquo;s a bit unfair to rocks, who are actually <a href="https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/wrinkled-time/">very smart</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My music player has forgotten my wifi name and password and refuses to reconnect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s work laptop is making all kinds of noises trying to attract her attention, oblivious to the fact that she&rsquo;s not here, and hasn&rsquo;t been for a good ten minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s our microwave. So many buttons, settings and options. We use it several times a day and only ever tell it to heat food or drink for x number of seconds or minutes. But it&rsquo;s brainless, and if you don&rsquo;t keep an eye on it like a small child it will spill your drink or chuck food everywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My kettle sits quietly now, but I know that when I go to boil water for my tea later it will keep on boiling the water until I manually switch it off, despite all its various settings for different boil temperatures and offers to the keep the water warm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the expensive toaster. Another one like the kettle that promises to toast (or defrost) every possible variety of bread-based product on its own individual setting, and with six settings for how brown you want it. Wonderful! The grim reality is that there are just two settings. &ldquo;Untoasted &ldquo;and &ldquo;Set the smoke alarm off&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m showing my space-obsessed four year old pictures of Pluto taken by a telescope on a spaceship launched from Earth twenty years ago and I still can&rsquo;t get a toaster that can do somewhere in between soft, cold bread and cremation.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t laugh. We think Al is dumb, but we elect dumber, and Al will only get less dumb (and more dangerous).</p>
<p>How long before The Mossad detonates my toaster?</p>
<p>In fact, eighteen years ago (I mean, really?) I bought the cheapest toaster I could find in Argos for £10. I plugged it in, put in my rounds of bread and pressed play. Two minutes later, the plastic surround had literally melted.</p>
<p>I would go back to holding a toasting fork over an open fire, but/as my kids point out every Xmas) we don&rsquo;t have a chimney.</p>

			 <p>My driving instructor told me that I would have to learn to drive twice. Once to pass my driving test (which I did first time, rather fortuitously), and once to learn to drive like everyone else does (i.e., with little regard to the laws of the land, the rules of the road, or the Highway Code).</p>
<p>He also gave me some more sound advice to be a good driver: in addition to getting from A to B, my aim should be to avoid causing other road users to brake, stop or get out of my way. I&rsquo;m not perfect, so I don&rsquo;t always get this right, but it&rsquo;s something I always remember and try to do.</p>
<p>One of the best pieces of advice I ever received was from a friend who was totally into cars and bikes, driving them, riding them, taking them apart and putting them back together again.</p>
<p>His advice was to <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/20/always-look-as.html">always look ahead as far as possible</a>. It sounds obvious, but most drivers used to look no further than the end of their bonnet (and nowadays, of course, most are looking down at their phones).</p>
<p>Looking head as far as possible means you can see what&rsquo;s going on and get a literal heads-up on any possible hazards approaching - children, people approaching a crossing point, slow moving vehicles, vehicles approaching a turning, emergency vehicles, etc.</p>
<p>(If only I&rsquo;d applied this advice to the rest of my life! So many wrong turns, dead ends, car crash moments, write-offs, months getting roadworthy again&hellip;.)</p>
<p>I also like to give way to other road users (small acts of solidarity) so that they can turn or perform whatever manoeuvre they need to do, or walk and cross safely. Although this sometimes results in drivers behind me (who obviously have no idea what I&rsquo;m playing at) honking their horns at me or even overtaking me (this actually happens surprisingly often at the zebra crossing next to my sons&rsquo; school).</p>
<p>As a bonus, this strategy means that every weekday on the school run I get my road rage going by holding every other driver to my own standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The speeding cars as I turn out of our <em>cul-de-sac</em> on to the notionally 20 mph limit &ldquo;main&rdquo; road.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the junction by our local pub where cars crossing are supposed to give way. Every day I pass there I slow down in anticipation of someone speeding through regardless, and I often have to brake sharply or stop to allow someone to turn into my lane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directly ahead, the pinch point that stops lorries from getting stuck further down gives priority to drivers going in my direction, and while it&rsquo;s badly designed, I usually have to give way to oncoming drivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The road it leads on to is effectively a one way street as the exit is marked with a no entry sign for vehicles who would otherwise turn into it. But it&rsquo;s routinely ignored and drivers coming the other way always seem to be in a great hurry in between the cars parked on either side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the turn into the big main road from another one way street. The number of times I&rsquo;m stuck behind someone turning right, who could have moved over to the right to allow me to turn left, but no, they need to take up the middle of the road. It&rsquo;s easier now the council repainted the &ldquo;Keep Clear&rdquo; road markings, and that also has encouraged more drivers on the main road to give way and allow us to turn left and right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of the middle of the road, that appears to be the preferred place for drivers of ever larger vehicles to drive. Maybe they&rsquo;re frightened of hitting a parked car or they can&rsquo;t envisage exactly how wide their vehicle is?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I have to get out of their way as they&rsquo;re probably not even looking.</p>

			 <p>I step out of my house and immediately notice the artificial &ldquo;cotton fresh&rdquo; scent of odour suppressants wafting south from the old Gasworks site. How can this be? They finished remediating the contaminated earth in 2019, and people have been living there in the new homes they built since 2021.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s better than the smell of petrol, which is what we had to put up with day and night for months on end in 2018. Bad enough to wake us up in the night during the long hot summer.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s better than the smell of tar, which we still get when the wind is blowing from the west. Before the asphalt plant was built, we didn&rsquo;t get any odours even though there is also a Tarmac plant nearby. The Asphalt plant owners say that is because the Nestle coffee plant closed. The (burnt?) coffee smell masked the tar.</p>
<p>I get around the corner of my block, on my morning walk, and see the small industrial estate that was the bane of our life for months in 2022. The main culprits were the paper recylcling company, which had its own incinerator for burning (believe it or not) plastics and coated wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Their neighbour opposite was a custom kitchen furniture maker, which also had its own incinerator for burning laminated particle fibreboard. The garage at the front regularly burns stuff in an old oil barrel.</p>
<p>All of which contributed to some of the most disgusting odours imaginable blowing into our kitchen, bathroom and hallway whe the wind blew from the north-east.</p>
<p>I walked down the street to the corner where the local council installed a tiny corner &ldquo;wildflower garden&rdquo;, which my wife and kids loved because it smelled so good. Two years later, it&rsquo;s reduced to a dumping ground (no one could have foreseen this).</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2024/pxl-20241214-093235070.mp.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A pile of mattresses, wooden pallets, and other debris is stacked on a sidewalk next to a white car and a trailer."></p>
<p>Further on my walk, past the homes reeking of marijuana, and weaving in and out of the obstacle course of bed bases mattresses and pallets stren across the pavements, I reach the town and smell the food aromas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the old Honey Monster factory, which used to regale us with the smell of roasted (burnt?) onions (I know, right?).</p>
<p>And my first visit to Southall (in daylight hours), twenty odd years ago, turning left out of the old station and naively going into the underpass. The stench of piss that hit me! &ldquo;Welcome to Southall!&rdquo; indeed.</p>
<p>I finished my walk through the town and back up round and through the park. If I&rsquo;d gone further up the canal by my sons&rsquo; school I would have got the smell of the narrowboats&rsquo; wood-burning stoves, which sometimes fills the school playground and causes kids to have to use their inhalers.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;d walked along the main road home or by the junction with the big industrial estate I would have choked on the heavy air filled with the exhaust fumes from cars and lorries.</p>
<p>Southall stinks so bad that the council set up its own <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201283/our_neighbourhoods/2613/southall_gasworks/6">Southall Odours web page, email and hotline</a> where you can report bad smells. Because if you don&rsquo;t report it, the council can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky, you might see something done after a year or two of complaining, as long as you can withstand the constant gaslighting.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unlucky, and you&rsquo;re not already dead or too ill to complain, you&rsquo;ll be branded a troublemaker and excluded from local democracy.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;ll be told to move by the council&rsquo;s community safety director.</p>

			 <p>If I understand this correctly: it&rsquo;s illegal in the UK to say or do anything that could be construed as support for the democratically elected government of Gaza and likewise for a party of the democratically elected government of Lebanon because we designate them as proscribed terrorist organisations.</p>
<p>The outgoing US president brokered a one-sided ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel, which allows Israel to continue bombing Lebanon and illegally invading and occupying its sovereign territory.</p>
<p>As soon as this ceasefire was in place, the Israeli prime minister threatened the president of Syria, and the armed militia formerly known as al-Qaeda/ISIS/Daesh/al-Nusra (who we designate as proscribed terrorist organisations) proceeded to violently overthrow the government of Syria (who we did not designate as a terrorist organisation despite all the bad press).</p>
<p>Incidentally, the leader of this armed militia formerly known as al-Qaeda/ISIS/Daesh/al-Nusra was previously held in US detention facilities in Iraq for several years and was coincidentally released just in time to form Al-Nusra at the start of Syrian Civil War in 2011.</p>
<p>The leader of this armed militia formerly known as al-Qaeda/ISIS/Daesh/al-Nusra has now formed the new government in Syria.</p>
<p>They are the good guys and are really very moderate compared to the former government of Syria - the bad guys (which is presumably why we didn&rsquo;t proscribe them as a terrorist organisation).</p>
<p>While all this is happening, Israel is bombing Syria and illegally invading and occupying its sovereign territory. And Israel continues to <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/11/free-palestine.html">obliterate Gaza</a>. All paid for by the good ol&rsquo; US of A.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>I was in Hounslow, west London last year. I went to a cafe in a leisure centre. I&rsquo;m not proud of it, I was volunteering with my son&rsquo;s school. And I&rsquo;m alone, I&rsquo;m not eating or drinking and I&rsquo;m <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/09/29/human-shield.html">writing in my notebook</a>, right? Teacher walks over to me: &ldquo;Hey, what you writing for?&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that the weirdest fucking question you&rsquo;ve ever heard? Not what am I <strong>writING</strong>, but what am I writing <strong>FOR</strong>? Well, god dammit, you stumped me! Why do I write? Well&hellip; hmmm&hellip; I dunno&hellip; I guess I write for a lot of reasons and the main one is so I don&rsquo;t end up being a fucking teacher!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this didn&rsquo;t happen, and it the joke doesn&rsquo;t really work like this. Leaving aside <a href="https://youtu.be/BwkdGr9JYmE?si=MWv5HRvKZ0HsdtGE">Bill Hicks</a> unnecessary misogyny and condescending attitude towards our sisters in the hospitality industry - you have to admit, though, he would have been funnier than the (ri)bald bloke on Masterchef - the question stands. What <strong>am</strong> I writing for? Why do I write?</p>
<p>Well, the truth is, I write for a number of reasons. The main one being because it&rsquo;s something I enjoy doing. Typing up blog posts on the fly in the cafe of the leisure centre where my son and his class did their weekly swimming lesson allowed me an hour to create something with no internal editor or censor stopping me. It was very cathartic. Writing this now with a pen and paper at the kitchen table is the same.</p>
<p>So, mainly I write for me, which is liberating. It helps me breathe and to feel alive.</p>
<p>But I also write for my sons. One day I&rsquo;ll be gone, probably while they are still too young, and I&rsquo;d like to leave them with something of me that they can get to know when that time comes. My oldest is always asking me to tell him stories about when I was young, but I&rsquo;m very bad at that, and can&rsquo;t remember much that&rsquo;s appropriate for a ten year old anyway.</p>
<p>In my twenties, I used to write and receive back copious letters from friends, but also from my Dad and his Mum, my Grannie. One day my Dad&rsquo;s letters stopped coming. There was no reason, or even hint of a reason. I was several thousand miles away at the time, so unable to investigate. The story I was told turned out to be a spiteful load of old bollocks, but at the time it was the only one I had, and so I believed it. I don&rsquo;t feel like I know my Dad very well at all, but what I do know is that he seemed to find most enjoyment and fulfilment in his life when he was away.</p>
<p>After I explained to my son&rsquo;s teacher that I was writing for pleasure, one of the swimming instructors at the next table gets up, stands over me and goes, &ldquo;Well, looks like we got ourselves a writer!&rdquo; while all the kids in their swimming costumes tried to peer over my shoulder from behind the glass screen to see what I was writing, laughing and pointing at me. That only lasted a few seconds, thankfully, before they all got on with their swimming lesson and left me in peace.</p>

			 <p>Breathing calmed down so went for a short walk to the corner shop with Kid A where he bought a can of baked beans with his own cash.</p>
<p>Then we walked around the long block talking about how those beans are now his beans, what would happen to the beans if I reimbursed him with a bank transfer, what he could do with a bottomless backpack, the striking similarity between the Chinese lion adorning a neighbour&rsquo;s drive wall and the Chinese lions outside the Chinese restaurant in Spilsby, and how Lime bikes are taking over the world.</p>

			 <p>The recent farmers&rsquo; protests in the UK and a comment on micro.blog about old style rectangular straw bales reminded me (again) of <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/11/24/curriculum-vitae-ad.html">my own farming history</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, obviously, without farmers we don&rsquo;t eat. All those fields left to grow wild kindly paid for by the European Union&hellip; oh, wait, that freebie blew away in the Farage wind and now costs us £2.4 billion of our own money every year.</p>
<p>Talking of wind, apparently the new inheritance tax farmers are protesting will <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/uk-inheritance-tax-reform-free-up-land-renewable-energy#:~:text=However%2C%20following%20the%20changes%20announced,becomes%20available%20for%20different%20uses.%E2%80%9D">incentivise them to use or sell their farmland for use as wind or solar farms</a>. Presumably to keep the lights and the air conditioning on for the rich when it all goes tits up, while the rest of us scrabble around blaming immigrants and woke lefties.</p>
<p>Farmers are notoriously tight-fisted, as I related in my own story about having my farm labouring wages deducted by the farmer after he gave me a lift home. Tight as a duck&rsquo;s arse as we used to say. Steve, the farmer&rsquo;s foreman, walked like a duck. Probably because he spent all day sitting on a tractor shovelling straw bales on to trailers for us to stack.</p>
<p>My first day on the bales ended in disaster. Steve could have lifted me down on his tractor shovel thing, as he he did many times thereafter, but instead allowed newbie me to slide down the ropes we&rsquo;d just tightened.</p>
<p>My fingertips took several days to regrow. I had fifty pence deducted from my wages for the cost of replenishing the first aid kit, and received a straight knockout for bleeding on the ropes.</p>
<p>Baling was actually decent fun when you got used to the physical aspect of the work. I worked with my mate who lived on the same road, and it was a challenge to stack the bales in the right way and learn particular tricks for making them fit into impossibly small spaces. The lorry drivers often helped and, being Northumbrians, they were usually a good crack. They wanted to get out of here as quickly as possible and to make sure their load wasn&rsquo;t going to topple over on the long road back to Cockermouth.</p>
<p>The days were often hot and long, and I would spend a lot of time visualising my first pint of the evening when we were done. But invariably, by the time I&rsquo;d got home, soaked in the bath, eaten and gone out, the last thing I wanted was beer. I usually drank a shandy instead and went home for an early night.</p>

			 <p>Some highlights and thoughts from <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781839760297">Yesterday&rsquo;s Man: The Case Against Joe Biden</a> by Branko Marcetic 📚</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Against Biden&rsquo;s best efforts, disaster had been averted. (p. 127)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to sum up his career neatly. Far from the popular public image that he has cultivated and that the media have happily gone along with for the most part.</p>
<h2 id="foreign-policy">Foreign policy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m not going to start World War Three for you!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not Biden, but British army General Mike Jackson refusing to follow Biden’s friend General Wesley Clark&rsquo;s orders to confront Russia in Kosovo. (p. 172)</p>
<p>The book was written before Russia invaded Ukraine. It seems that Biden wants to go out with a bang, despite his previous utterances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”There is no such thing as a winnable nuclear war.” (p. 152)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Biden saying one thing and doing another is characteristic of his entire political career. He’s not unique in that respect, of course, and perhaps he’s actually better at it than most. He did get elected president after all.</p>
<h3 id="israel">Israel</h3>
<p>Biden was the ultimate Friend of Israel. He helped provide Israel with huge amounts of US aid money, and Israel lobbyists on his campaign staff returned the favour helping Biden raise huge amounts of money to run his various election campaigns.</p>
<p>Biden spent his entire career giving unqualified support to Israel, and claimed that Americans &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t afford&rdquo; to criticise Israel in public.</p>
<h3 id="yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Toward the end of Bush&rsquo;s term, the ex-communist Eastern European country of Yugoslavia began disintegrating in a miasma of nationalism and ethnic and religious sectarianism, forces unleashed by a Western-imposed program of economic &ldquo;shock therapy&rdquo; that in essence exported Western neoliberal policies to the once prosperous country, running its living standards into the ground. War soon broke out. (p. 156)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, Biden agitated for Clinton’s military intervention in Serbia, which lay the foundations for future “humanitarian” bombing campaigns elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you cared about political survival, it was safer to err on the side of war. (p. 158)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="iraq">Iraq</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite [or because of?] his role in starting the war, Biden was still considered one of the party&rsquo;s wisest heads on foreign policy. (p. 173)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>George W. Bush apparently followed Biden&rsquo;s instructions on selling the war on Iraq to the American people and the United Nations.</p>
<p>Biden proposed an ethno-nationalist “three state solution” for Iraq similar to Israel&rsquo;s proposals to came up Arab states into weaker sectarian units.</p>
<p>He proposed to Balkanise Iraq into smaller ethnic and religious sectarian states with limited freedom of movement and borders controlled by foreign troops.</p>
<p>A bit like Gaza and the rest of the illegally Occupied Palestinian Territories now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flawed as it was, the plan burnished Biden&rsquo;s credentials as a foreign policy expert. (p. 179)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Iraq duped Biden forcing withdrawal of US troops. In response, ISIS ‘emerged&rsquo; from an oppressed religious minority.</p>
<h3 id="war-on-terror">War on Terror</h3>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s &lsquo;counter-terrorism plus&rsquo; policy saw the US bomb seven Muslim countries without declaring war, much like Israel is now doing with more American bombs.</p>
<p>That helped to fuel anti-Americanism and an immigration and prisons crisis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of providing homes for the poor, he would spend the following decades housing them in jails. (p. 85)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="domestic-policy">Domestic policy</h2>
<h3 id="race-relations">Race relations</h3>
<p>Racist Clinton doubled the American prison population and achieved the world&rsquo;s highest rate of incarceration. Mostly with black people.</p>
<p>This policy usefully helped to reduce official unemployment figures and paint Clinton&rsquo;s neoliberalism as an economic miracle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another lesson Biden had first wrongly internalised from American apartheid: that people of different backgrounds simply couldn&rsquo;t live together in harmony. (p. 177)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead Biden backed segregation (busing) and individual states&rsquo; rights over a united federal states of America.</p>
<h3 id="womens-rights">Women’s rights</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>”I don&rsquo;t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body.” (p. 184)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Biden on the Roe v. Wade decision in 1974</p>
<h2 id="bidens-neoliberalism">Biden’s neoliberalism</h2>
<p>Biden presented as a progressive liberal on the side of the working class. But he spent his career siding with Republicans and moving the Democrats ever further to the right.</p>
<p>At one time even a former Klan recruiter thought Biden had gone too far. Another Klan leader praised Biden&rsquo;s election platform claiming it was as if it had been written by a Klansman.</p>
<h3 id="supporting-spending-cuts">Supporting spending cuts</h3>
<p>Biden said Jimmy Carter was nothing special, and welcomed Reaganomics as a step in the right direction. Although in typical Biden fashion he also claimed Reagan&rsquo;s first budget would be an economic disaster before voting for it (along with 29 other Democrats).</p>
<p>Reagan&rsquo;s cuts cost 270,000 jobs and reduced access to financial support for millions of Americans. Rather than reducing the deficit, it increased it, and made the rich richer, and the poor poorer.</p>
<p>Like Thatcher in Britain, Reagan&rsquo;s greatest achievement was in transforming his opposition into his mirror image. You still get a choice at the polls, but there&rsquo;s very little, if any, substantive policy difference between the two.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Biden isn&rsquo;t a liberal anymore.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ayn Rand acolyte Paul Ryan, who lost to Biden in the 2012 vice-presidential election, but declared a more important victory.</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s support for tax cuts for the rich wasn&rsquo;t a one-off. This was a repeated pattern of voting indicating where his true loyalties lay. Indeed, later he proposed his own tax cuts that were more severe than Reagan&rsquo;s, and “right out of the Tea Party playbook”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where once the tyranny of &ldquo;special interests&rdquo; meant the control of government by big business and the super-rich, it now referred to the ordinary Americans the New Deal had sought to protect from those same powerful entities. (p. 68)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No longer aligned with the working class, Biden now focused on the middle class, solidly Conservative, tax-and-government fearing supporters of the super-rich.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”It&rsquo;s the middle class, stupid.” (p.147)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much like the South where Biden always pivoted for support of anti-union, pro-slavery and white supremacist votes. Biden could have tried to bring Southern voters to the Democrats, but instead chose to lead the Democrats to align with the politics of the South.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden had successfully facilitated the decades-long wholesale robbery of working- class Americans by law enforcement. (p. 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enter Bill Clinton, who with Biden&rsquo;s full support, carried on Reagan&rsquo;s economic policies leading to ever more cuts in government spending and hardship for millions more Americans.</p>
<p>Biden again offered trillions of dollars of cuts to retirement funds, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps, giving Mitch McConnell everything he asked for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As president, much of Obama&rsquo;s job involved cleaning up messes that Biden had helped create. (p. 191)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The major legislative accomplishments that Biden had racked up in prior decades had succeeded because they had been in pursuit of Republican goals. (p. 199)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden did what he always did: plead fealty to working class voters in public speeches filled with references to his Scranton roots while privately appealing for the support of big-money interests. (p. 214)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By 2020, Biden had shifted (and shifted the Democrats) so far to the right, he was finally electable and the safest establishment option to defeat Trump as president.</p>

			 <p>I wrote this a week ago.</p>
<p>My last journal was over a week ago, last Saturday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a week off work with a really bad cough, wheezing, shortness of breath. Generally feeling better these last couple of days, but also still coughing. Last two days I had coughing fits in the afternoons leaving me dizzy, and exhausted. I haven&rsquo;t slept well some nights either, due to coughing, wheezing and breathlessness.</p>
<p>But sitting here right now, I feel as good as I have done in two weeks or more.</p>
<p>Time off from work has allowed me to go through 90 days of journal entries to categorise and summarise them, and then outline or tease out the key themes or ideas in each area of interest. Why? Well, 1) what are all these journal entries for? I mean, I get the process, but am I missing out on something greater? 2) Lots of people publish weekly summaries and some people like reading them. But why?</p>
<p>I think I get it now. Doing this work has made sense of a lot of daily, weekly and monthly events, habits, routines, scenarios, relationships, that otherwise would have remained loosely connected, strung together like the Christmas lights every year when you take them out of the box you left them in in January. In a mess, tangled up, half working. Better than nothing, but a lot of stress.</p>
<p>And another surprising fact. While I started - and soon stopped - journaling in March, then restarted in August, I had wondered if spending the time to write in a private journal would take away from writing for my blog? Actually (and unsurprisingly, really) the opposite has occurred. I have written more than ever, privately and publicly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also generally felt better in myself, although I&rsquo;ve still had my usual ups and downs, and I&rsquo;m still quite easily uplifted and dragged down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also made me realise I do a lot more things than I imagined, and do them OK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helped me to better understand some of my relationships, particularly with family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading more, and listening to music more.</p>
<p>It would be useful (although perhaps less fun)to do the same exercise with my work journal. (41 pages, 46 days).</p>
<p>244 pages over 90 days for my personal journal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t journaled since.</p>

She was the big new thing, breathlessly jumping around all over the place, <a href="https://youtu.be/jKbgrzjUlFY">climbing up the gantry</a>, as she showcased her debut album <em>Lungs</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="https://www.florenceandthemachinefanclub.com/lungs-photoshoot/">Lungs album cover photoshoot stills - Tom Beard 2009</a></p>
<p>Or maybe it was 2015. <em><a href="https://youtu.be/ZDXkD4l0ZBE">Ship To Wreck</a></em> sounds so familiar and like it would have caught my ear.</p>
<p>All very dramatic, elemental, and possibly not quite my thing more generally at those particular times. I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention then or since.</p>
<p>By then, I&rsquo;d fallen out of love with life, not just music. In recent years, I&rsquo;ve rediscovered music, and life, and this week <em>Florence + The Machine</em>.</p>
<p>My little kid is 4 ½ years old. He&rsquo;s obsessed with space at the moment. When he was younger, and still napping in the day, we found that he enjoyed falling asleep to a variety of music videos on YouTube. Mostly videos of music <em>I</em> liked. I don&rsquo;t know how that happened!</p>
<p>At one time he really enjoyed some of the <em>NPR Tiny Desk</em> concerts - bands playing stripped down acoustic or semi-acoustic fifteen minute sets on a tiny office stage in front of a small audience.</p>
<p>Two he really liked were <em><a href="https://youtu.be/uwUt1fVLb3E">Alicia Keys</a></em> and <em><a href="https://youtu.be/ze4xcmBFvaE">Jon Batiste</a></em> - which weren&rsquo;t my choices (well, they were my choices, but now I had permission to choose them), but I grew to love them, too. It&rsquo;s hard not love such amazing musicianship, singing and songs, all performed with unconfined joy in the moment. My son got it. So did I.</p>
<p>One he wasn&rsquo;t so keen on, but I enjoyed, was <em>Florence + The Machine&rsquo;s</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/EkPrXL-H5Qc">Tiny Desk</a> performance. Usually so full of bombast, almost over-produced, and perfect for rocking out stadium tours, this was vulnerable and exposed. Two voices, a harp, acoustic guitar and keyboard. Three perfect songs.</p>
<p>I really tried to listen to more, the album versions, but I still couldn&rsquo;t get into them.</p>
<p>This week, with my focus on my own personal breathlessness and <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/search/?q=lung">lung history</a>, and still thinking about <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/19/got-carter.html">another Machine</a> entirely, I tried again. I still couldn&rsquo;t do it, not fully. I now liked the album versions of the Tiny Desk songs, but the rest washed over me. I read more about the band, the albums, reviews, trying <a href="https://www.34st.com/article/2019/10/florence-the-machine-lungs-ten-year-anniversary-sad-girl-fall-lana-del-rey">to understand why people like them so much</a>.</p>
<p>Then last night, I finally got it. I cant explain why, exactly. Maybe it&rsquo;s just familiarity. Probably it&rsquo;s paying attention. As with many things in life, you sometimes have to make an effort to learn to appreciate things and develop a taste (or ear) for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each breath screaming / &lsquo;We are all too young to die,&rsquo;” Welch sings in the chorus of “Between Two Lungs&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do wonder also, though, if sometimes songs speak to me even when I&rsquo;m not actively listening? I&rsquo;ve always been useless at remembering lyrics. Not great for singing songs in a band. But the songs I love for the music, the energy, the tunes&hellip; When I do pay attention to the words, sometimes years later, they do carry meaning for me (even if that&rsquo;s not necessarily what the song is actually about). They just needed to be heard. That&rsquo;s the beauty of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No more gasping for a breath<br>
The air has filled me head-to-toe<br>
And I can see the ground far below<br>
I have this breath and I hold it tight<br>
And I keep it in my chest with all my might<br>
I pray to god this breath will last</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>Lincolnshire sausages are the finest sausages you can get.</p>
<p>I remember as a boy, fifty years ago, my grandmother making sausages at home for the local butcher. Sometimes, she would let me feed the sausage meat into the machine and then turn the handle to push it through into the skins.</p>
<p>A special treat then was boiled sausages for breakfast. The skins would fall off, and we ate them with white bread soaked in the soup or broth they created in the pan along with a dash of English mustard.</p>
<p>In later years, my Mum would travel to Boston in south Lincolnshire from her home in north Lincolnshire specially to buy sausages from the butcher who made the best Lincolnshire sausages.</p>
<p>She would freeze them and pack me off with ten or twelve wrapped in old newspaper whenever I came back to visit from university or when I first moved to Manchester and then London.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a proper Lincolnshire sausage for many years now. The ones we get now are made in Hampshire. They&rsquo;re nice enough, better than any other variety of supermarket sausage I&rsquo;ve tried, but you wouldn&rsquo;t want to boil them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty versatile. They&rsquo;re great with mashed potatoes and gravy, in <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2005/02/19/bangers-n-mash.html">a special Valentine&rsquo;s casserole</a>, in a Yorkshire pudding, with xmas dinner wrapped in bacon, <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2011/11/07/bonfire-of-the.html">in a bread finger roll</a> with (<a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2011/11/08/no-onions-but.html">or without</a>) onions and ketchup, in a sandwich or, as my kids like to eat them, cold on their own in the bath after school.</p>

			 <p>I started watching <em>Person of Interest</em> almost three months ago thanks to a recommendation from <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/08/22/tv-watching.html">Hippy Steve</a>. Obviously I&rsquo;m about thirteen years after everyone else, as it first aired in 2011. At that time, I was busy singing songs about <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2011/07/19/theres-only-one.html">one J Carter</a>&hellip;.</p>
<p><em>Person of Interest</em> is a post 9/11 surveillance thriller, although I still think my initial impression of the first episode - <em>Minority Report</em> meets <em>Police Squad!</em> wasn&rsquo;t far off. After watching two and a half seasons, I&rsquo;d add a good old dollop of <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> into the mix.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, the whole five seasons was free to watch on Amazon Prime, with just a thirty second ad break halfway through each episode.</p>
<p>The basic premise for the show is that we are surrounded by cameras recording our every move. The US government wanted to create an automatic means of harnessing all this information for the greater good - preventing terror attacks on its territory.</p>
<p>The creator of this artificial intelligence - known as <em>The Machine</em> - now has sole access to it. And he is using it to prevent not just terror attacks, but also everyday attacks on ordinary people. People who the government were never interested in because they were irrelevant to national security.</p>
<p>Finch, who is obviously the brains of the operation, hires some brawn - Reese - to do the dangerous work of physically intervening to prevent daily murders. In fact, Finch rescues Reese from whisky-fuelled vagrancy after his former life as a CIA special agent has fallen apart, and offers him redemption. He&rsquo;s still a hired hitman, but he doesn&rsquo;t have to kill anyone anymore, just save them from murder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/19/people-dont-change.html">People don&rsquo;t change, but they can make good decisions</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily there&rsquo;s only one murder a day, and Reese is just as capable sloshed, slashed, shot, and tied up. He&rsquo;s the human embodiment of <em>The Machine</em> - <em>Superman</em>, infallible, with all the (ir)relevant information fed to him by Finch via an earpiece and every conceivable weapon, perfect timing and lucky escape available to him, along with miraculous recovery from injury.</p>
<p>Between them, they are all-seeing, all-knowing, and omnipresent, and the recipient of mysterious cryptic phone calls revealing the social security number of the next murder victim or perpetrator.</p>
<p>Soon we start meeting new regular characters. The would-be mob boss working undercover as a shy, socially conscious high school teacher in the toughest area in town. The police homicide detective (one J Carter) looking for &ldquo;The man in the suit&rdquo; - Reese - who keeps being seen at the scene of the incredible deaths of various villains. The corrupt police officers (dirty cops known collectively as <em>HR</em>) who protect and serve themselves and their criminal and mob friends. Including Fusco, who is assigned to work with Carter, and recruited by Reese as an inside source and dirty worker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t run from the past forever, but love is real</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Season Two is definitely a cut above Season One. The characters are more rounded, there are more of them, their interactions and back stories are playing out and getting entangled. Finch and Fusco have, or had, love lives. Reese is looking out for Carter even though she&rsquo;s still officially hunting him. Reese acquires a killer Dutch dog called Bear and keeps him as a pet to protect Finch from the mysterious and powerful <em>root</em> who has been watching everything he does and who wants access to <em>The Machine</em>.</p>
<p>Then, out of the blue, halfway through S2, I can&rsquo;t watch it anymore! Not without parting with £17.99! But by now I&rsquo;m hooked, watching an episode almost every evening. £17.99 gets me the information that it was Finch who ordered Reese and his duplicitous CIA partner to be killed in China, and sociopath Shaw joins the team after her old boss <em>Control</em> tried to kill her. My old boss&rsquo;s <em>doppelganger</em> turns up in one episode as a serial killer identity thief in a good old-fashioned <em>Columbo</em> episode where everyone is stuck on an island in the middle of a hurricane, and everyone except the killer is a suspect until it&rsquo;s (almost) too late. Fusco killed his old dirty cop partner Stills and buried him in the woods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carter and Bear dig up Stills&rsquo; body to save Fusco&rsquo;s ass</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finch gets captured by <em>root</em>. She wants to set <em>The Machine</em> free. It turns out Finch programmed <em>The Machine</em> to forget everything at the end of every day in an act of self-deletion. <em>root</em> seems to have some kind of connection with <em>The Machine</em> and sees it as a living organism.</p>
<p>In Season Three, Carter brings down HR, including HR&rsquo;s chief henchman and all round bad guy Simmons. Or does she? No, she doesn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s somehow still alive. It&rsquo;s getting silly.</p>
<p>Reese&rsquo;s number is up. By now, he&rsquo;s in love with Carter, and she&rsquo;s in love with him. She dies in his arms, shot in the chest by the evil Simmons, who escapes yet again. Simmons brutally tortures the now extremely likeable Fusco, breaking three of his fingers before sentencing both Fusco and his young son to death. Shaw manages to save Fusco&rsquo;s son, but she can&rsquo;t be in two places at once&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dirty cop turned hero</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow, Fusco manages to free his ties and garrote his executioner before he can pull the trigger. Then he finds a strangely unarmed Simmons before he can fly to safety. But instead of shooting him, or even arresting him, he first decides to fist fight him with three broken fingers. Bear in mind that Simmons is hard as nails, and Fusco is short, fat, and a bit of a softie at heart.</p>
<p>Against all the odds, Fusco wins and takes cop-killer Simmons in.</p>
<p>After Carter&rsquo;s death, Reese goes AWOL and back on the bottle. Fusco finds him out west and they end up in a slapstick brawl in the rain. Meanwhile, Finch and Shaw are captured by the evil <em>Control</em> and her evil Odd Bod henchman Hersh, but miraculously saved by <em>root</em> (who by now had been captured and caged by Finch).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got bored</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Halfway through S3 I gave up. Reese and Fusco miraculously saved Finch and Shaw, who were themselves captured by <em>Vigilance</em> (a violent pro-privacy campaign group), then Hersh. <em>root</em> was captured by <em>Control</em> and brutally tortured, but somehow managed to escape, turn the tables and then save everyone.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t mentioned the mysterious, sinister and extremely evil elderly Englishman who seemed to be running the whole show (actually the show&rsquo;s creator&rsquo;s grandfather in real life), who managed to look like death and worse than Michael Gambon in <em>The Singing Detective</em>.</p>
<p>If you like guns, shooting people, torture, (mock) executions, (child) kidnapping, (attempted) murder, blackmail, gambling, Russian Roulette, cyber-stalking, identity theft, mob rule and police corruption, you&rsquo;ll probably like <em>Person of Interest</em>. I was into it for around fifty or so episodes, but it became too much, too repetitive, too cliched. They killed off the only J Carter, and I can&rsquo;t have that, even if J Bezos has another £17.99 from me.</p>

			 <p>People don&rsquo;t change, but they can make good decisions.</p>
<p>This is a quote, or the gist of a quote, from an episode of Person of Interest, a TV show I watched avidly for two and a half seasons before rapidly losing interest after the scriptwriters killed off one of the only characters with a fully functioning sense of empathy (who happened to be a black woman) and which therewith descended into a cliched, repetitive, and all-too predictable (yet surprising) slapstick parody of itself.</p>
<p>If I wanted to watch a bunch of psychopaths endlessly escalate a brutal war on humanity I could just look at the news. Americans sure like their guns and shooting people for entertainment. Personally, I prefer a nice cup of tea and a good book, and a bit of peace and quiet.</p>
<p>Anyway, people don&rsquo;t change, but they can make good decisions. Especially when they have enough guns pointed at their head. That&rsquo;s the takeaway, or the moral of this story. But they always escape, and then they&rsquo;re back to making bad decisions all over again, usually involving pointing guns at other people&rsquo;s heads.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s right. People don&rsquo;t change. Not until there&rsquo;s a compelling reason to. We carry on mindlessly making the same old bad decisions over and over again like in Einstein&rsquo;s theory of insanity, repeating the same mistakes and expecting a different outcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a horrible take. But it&rsquo;s true to some extent. Getting better (it can&rsquo;t get much worse) can be a bit of a song (and a dance). Recovery is a long and winding road. They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a lot of resistance to change, and even to making good decisions.</p>
<p>But is much of this also a result of the world we live in, and who we are? We live in a world consumed by neoliberal orthodoxy. We are in thrall to the ideas of freedom of the market, the decimation of government and public services, and the freedom of individuals (and individual responsibility, even while what&rsquo;s left of the state bails out the greed and mistakes of unaccountable banks and corporations).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as society, Thatcher told us. There is no alternative.</p>
<p>Trump was right, Americans will never vote for a black woman. Hell, they wouldn&rsquo;t even vote for a warmongering white woman. The white supremacist patriarchy is strong. Yes, they voted for a black man, but he turned out to be the most murderous president in history.</p>
<p>Is there an alternative? There&rsquo;s always an alternative. It&rsquo;s just that usually the alternative is more of the same, or worse. Take it or leave it. And even when there is a different option, one which might slightly rein in the excesses of this neoliberal onslaught, it&rsquo;s demonised as a Stalinist coup that will murder Jews. &ldquo;Nothing. Has. Changed.&rdquo; implored Theresa May, quite rightly, as she continued as Prime Minister despite losing her massive parliamentary majority and failing to obtain a mandate to deliver Brexit, or anything other than her own resignation. Calling that election was the most audacious thing she ever did, aside from running through a field of wheat as a child.</p>
<p>Despite the people obviously voting for change, and genuine hope, it was clear that what we really needed instead was a lying, racist killer clown to run the country into the ground.</p>
<p>At least he had a plan. An oven-ready plan to deliver Brexit on a plate just in time for the New Year. It would be served cold, and thoroughly unappetising to everyone, toxic even. But it was the will of the people. It&rsquo;s what we wanted. We voted for it! We wanted to sever our economic ties to our nearest and biggest trading partner and experience the freedom of going it alone in the big wide world, unleashed!</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t enough! The killer clown told too many lies, and hosted too many parties in covid lockdown. He had to go. A tiny minority of elderly rich right wingers then voted for a new leader for us. One who would be more honest, less racist, less murderous, and not as stupid. Liz &ldquo;Pork Markets&rdquo; Truss.</p>
<p>Oh, fuck. She might not have been a liar, or a racist, or a murderer, but boy was she stupid. She killed the Queen, trashed the UK economy, and blew up Russia&rsquo;s Nordstream pipeline, all in less than a month. Talk about a whirlwind. And some bad decisions. She now has a very nice pension. You reap what you sow.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t change, but they can make good decisions. Neoliberalism doesn&rsquo;t change, and the more that the people are subjected to its bad decisions, its lust for war, for death, for oil, for money, for making the rich richer and the poor poorer, the harder it gets for people to change, and the fewer good decisions are made.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s obviously not me, and neither did I have my parcel.</p>
<p>I saw the DPD van outside my neighbour&rsquo;s block opposite, so figured he must have delivered there by mistake. But, no, my neighbour didn&rsquo;t have it (and he&rsquo;s not called Rhanderg either).</p>
<p>I opened a chat on the DPD app. The proof of delivery photo was taken at my neighbour&rsquo;s door. I was assured the driver would come back later, retrieve my parcel and deliver it to me. But I&rsquo;d already checked with my neighbour and they didn&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, the driver turns up with my parcel. He said he dropped his phone in the mud (and accidentally took a photo of him not delivering it to my neighbour&rsquo;s flat?).</p>

<h2 id="cheese-o-meter">Cheese-o-meter</h2>
<p>Without further <em>fondue</em>, here&rsquo;s my Cheese List.</p>
<ol>
<li>Triple Gloucester. The elusive holy grail of cheeses. From Gloucester.</li>
<li>Double Gloucester. If you have trouble finding Triple Gloucester, then you can&rsquo;t go wrong with its populist sibling Double. Trump-like appearance, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not a vote-winner. Biden-like quality: good all-rounder, mild, creamy, child-friendly, goes with most things, melts easily. Oily. Used in cheese rolling competitions. From Gloucester.</li>
<li>Single Gloucester. Pale and aloof, Double&rsquo;s estranged half-sister. From Gloucester.</li>
<li>Mature Cheddar. Hard, white, crumbles under pressure. The epitome of Englishness in cheese form. Ideal in a cheese and tomato sandwich, or a Ploughman&rsquo;s lunch. <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/01/08/grated-cheese-to.html">Mixes well (grated) with Double Gloucester</a>. From Cheddar.</li>
<li>Vintage Mature Cheddar. See 4, but harder, whiter and crumblier.</li>
<li>Mild Cheddar. See 4, but less pale, slightly softer, and less crumbly. Almost tasteless. Pointless waste of milk.</li>
<li>Red Leicester. Underrated cheese. Red. Makes a fine cheese sauce for cauliflower or <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/22/yesterdays-mac-n.html">macaroni</a>. Makes a great topping for a Shepherd&rsquo;s Pie (better than mixing Cheddar and Gloucester - Gloucester can get a bit oily). From Leicester.</li>
<li>Wensleydale. White, crumbly. Perfect with a <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/13/not-the-most.html">mince pie</a>. From Wensleydale.</li>
<li>Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Cheshire. Lumping these all together not because they&rsquo;re are all the same, but because it&rsquo;s so long since I tried them I can&rsquo;t remember what they are like. From Lancashire, Lincolnshire and Cheshire.</li>
<li>Gouda. Sliced foreign cheese. Kids eat it.</li>
<li>Edam. A very special Dutch cheese which is made backwards. Don&rsquo;t eat the rind!</li>
<li>Jarlsberg. Sliced foreign cheese. Full of holes.</li>
<li>Emmental. Stringy cheese. Good for toasties and the bin.</li>
<li>Swiss cheese. American cheese. From Switzerland.</li>
<li>Brie. Fancy French cheese. Round, rindy, soft and stinky. Nice with a cracker.</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol start="17">
<li>Camembert. See 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/8RmT094XH9g">It&rsquo;s like no cheese I&rsquo;ve ever tasted</a>.</li>
<li>Blue cheese. French. Mouldy. No thanks.</li>
<li>Stilton. See 18. Not French. From Stilton.</li>
<li>Ricotta. Soft, creamy. Perfect with spinach on a pizza, or better still in a <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/05/09/fear-and-loathing.html">calzone at Pizza World</a>.</li>
<li>Mozzarella. On a <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/10/19/i-thought-id.html">pizza</a>.</li>
<li>Mascarpone. In a cheesecake. Not a cake.</li>
<li>Halloumi. Fried. On its own or with olives, hummus, pitta. From Cyprus.</li>
<li>Feta. Greek salad. From Greece.</li>
<li>Cottage cheese. My Mum loves it. From a cottage. From-age?</li>
<li>Goats&rsquo; cheese. From goats.</li>
<li>Sheep&rsquo;s cheese. See 26, but from sheep.</li>
<li>Parmesan. Baby sick.</li>
<li>Smegma. You don&rsquo;t want to know where it&rsquo;s from. One of the first bands I was in at school was called The Amgems. We weren&rsquo;t as good or as funny as we thought we were.</li>
<li><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2010/04/24/confessions-of-a.html">Lung cheese</a>.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve worked from home since the end of February 2020. I transferred all my work and systems online to do so, and while I&rsquo;m still part-time, in practice I&rsquo;m now available 24/7 for every conceivable administrative emergency (&ldquo;Hi David. Please order me some large coloured post-it notes and have them delivered to my home tomorrow&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hi David. Please bring £200 in cash to my house this morning so I can pay for my lunch meeting today.&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t pretend I&rsquo;ve always been highly productive, in the office or at home. But I always get everything done that needs to be done, and I&rsquo;m super-flexible and adaptable. I&rsquo;ve been asked to do - and done - huge, complex projects at short notice and with short deadlines that are outside of my remit and frankly beyond my skill set, but I&rsquo;ve done them, learned how to do it on the spot or got help.</p>
<p>I do go into the office for occasional in-person meetings and social gatherings (&ldquo;xmas lunch&rdquo; looms) when necessary, and indeed spent a solid three hours working last Thursday with a masked colleague (she had a fever) in a freezing cold office. I&rsquo;d just recovered from a bad reaction to the covid vaccine. Next day was a write-off. I was exhausted and worried about whether the work we did was really good enough. The day after and since I&rsquo;ve had a terrible cough and cold, shortness of breath, wheezing. (Since my COPD diagnosis, every rasping breath I take is assessed and rediagnosed by my non-medic wife as requiring medical attention.)</p>
<p>My workplace is bad for my health. Pre-covid I had multiple chest infections that kept me away from work and reduced my productivity to zero for weeks at a time. Since I worked from home, and catching covid aside, I&rsquo;ve had zero time where I&rsquo;ve been unable to go to the office for essential work that can only be done there. Even when I&rsquo;ve had coughs and colds, I&rsquo;ve felt well enough to do the work that needed to be done. Somehow (until now with this new cough) I don&rsquo;t seem to get so ill or feel so bad when I&rsquo;m at home.</p>
<p>Working from home has given me the time and space to transform how I work for the better. I&rsquo;m better organised, more thoughtful, less rushed and distracted. I can honestly say that I&rsquo;m now the most productive I&rsquo;ve ever been thanks to a more comfortable, relaxed and focussed personal work space.</p>
<p>And, yes, being part-time, and flexible, I can take a nap if I need one.</p>

<p>Daniels wanted to know if Johnson had any children, and wondered if Johnson would leave his daughter alone with Trump. (Trump has a whole series of very serious sexual misconduct allegations against him.)</p>
<p>Johnson explained that he has met Trump and he&rsquo;s perfectly polite and well-mannered, so of course he would have no problem with him.</p>
<p>Johnson himself, of course, is famous among other things for being a serial liar and not knowing how many children he has.</p>

<p>Mental health patients are in hospital usually because they are incapable of living life in general let alone getting a job. Plus, mental health units are usually secure wards, so they can&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>IPS works because people are in recovery, receiving treatment that makes them feel better and well enough to start thinking about work.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week I received confirmation of a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) based on results of spirometry tests back in August (it took that long for my GP surgery to get the results from the test centre, and only after my own intervention after their repeated failures).</p>
<p>My GP helpfully seemed very keen to blame my twenty-odd year history of smoking.</p>
<p>I first smoked at about age 20. My parents were smokers (wasn&rsquo;t everyone back then?). I was never a heavy smoker. The most I ever smoked was ten a day. It&rsquo;s also true I smoked a number of other substances that didn&rsquo;t come with filters. And then there was some vaping. I suspect that might have been the worst of the lot, but who knows? I haven&rsquo;t smoked for ten years.</p>
<p>In my childhood, I remember several episodes of severe shortness of breath, e.g., when running around the sports field at primary school I collapsed gasping for breath, and unable to continue. I was never diagnosed with asthma. I was told to get up and stop being so weak.</p>
<p>As I got older, whenever the football season started, I could never get through a full game. I put it down to lack of fitness and stamina at the time, but whatever it was, the symptom was breathlessness. I was told to get fit and sent off on cross-country runs.</p>
<p>I had regular episodes of shortness of breath throughout young adulthood that were not triggered by exercise (I&rsquo;d more or less given up by then, helped by a dodgy ankle). I thought it might be hayfever or a dust allergy.</p>
<p>Fourteen years ago, I needed a thoracotomy on my right lung after a chest infection went wrong. I developed pleurisy, a collapsed lung and an empyema. In the post-op, my surgeon said my lung was &ldquo;as good as new&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the years before covid, I had frequent chest infections requiring antibiotics and time off work to recover. Then and now, I wonder if that was triggered by the <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/10/29/the-southall-gasworks.html">Southall Gasworks</a> remediation and air pollution?</p>
<p>I now see that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-67210-7">studies show</a> that exposure to volatile organic compounds (including benzene, naphthalene and toluene) is related to COPD.</p>
<p>The good news is that I had no symptoms of COPD, so it&rsquo;s been diagnosed at an early stage. I&rsquo;ve started with my new inhaler, and my wife reports that I&rsquo;ve stopped snoring.</p>

<p>I was hoping for a good night&rsquo;s sleep tonight, in preparation for a long drive tomorrow, but it&rsquo;s Diwali.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After watching and re-watching the same three-second clip of nothing happening for so long that here in the UK we had to put our clocks back another hour just to have enough time to finish the game, the match referee (Ross from Friends look-a-like David Coote) turned to face what he knew would be a worldwide audience of millions of armchair experts like me yelling &ldquo;VAR! WTF!&rdquo; at the screen in front of us. You could see in his face and his body language that he knew just like us it was ludicrous. Another referee sat in a business park office just down the road from me had told him to review his original decision - that nothing had happened - because the ref had made &ldquo;a clear and obvious&rdquo; error of judgment.</p>
<p>The late penalty awarded by VAR and converted by West Ham and England&rsquo;s Jarrod Bowen should duly result in the termination of the losing manager&rsquo;s contract. That&rsquo;s football. This VAR rubbish isn&rsquo;t, but we have to live with it for now.</p>
<p>This particular fiasco neatly sums up the entire ETH tenure. A clear and obvious error, if ever there was one, and yet we are forced to watch repeat after repeat, week after week of him getting it wrong. Team selections, tactics, transfers, substitutions. A bald man somehow getting balder every time the full time whistle blows.</p>
<p>If only United had a VAM. A Video Assistant Manager. Another (more capable manager) sat in a nearby office watching the game on a screen like you or me, who could intervene at key moments during the build-up to the game (team selection), during the game (tactical changes and subs), and off the pitch (transfers, man-management) to a whisper into Ten Hag&rsquo;s hairless ear: &ldquo;Hold on, Eric. I think that signing Antony for £80m is a clear and obvious error&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hi Eric, Maguire&rsquo;s a fucking liability mate&rdquo; or &ldquo;Eric, pal. We need to talk. Onana?&rdquo; I could go on but you get the drift.</p>
<p>Now, I know everyone rightly hates VAR for ruining the game, and it would be unfair to blame ETH for ruining United. But VAM would make it much more entertaining.</p>

			 <p>Watched the United game (on my laptop) yesterday, having missed the Southampton and Barnsley games.</p>
<p>A big improvement on the Liverpool debacle, especially in the first half.</p>
<p>Dalot playing as a LB, DM and playmaker/midfield general all at once was as unexpected as it was impressive.</p>
<p>Eriksen starting, to maintain the creative link he made with Mainoo against Barnsley we&rsquo;re told, was also unexpected, but it too somehow worked. Drifting left to cover Dalot rather undid his link with Mainoo, though.</p>
<p>Rashford benched, supposedly for &ldquo;rotation&rdquo;, went against all known football management laws about not changing a winning team and playing players who are in form and scoring goals.</p>
<p>It almost worked as Garnacho (who always looks like he has a goal in him, if nothing else) replaced him, but hit the bar with a thunderous effort from wide of the penalty box.</p>
<p>When the subs came, they undid all our tactical and positional advantage, perhaps as much due to Palace&rsquo;s positive changes as United&rsquo;s later nearly self-defeating swaps. Ugarte was a downgrade on Dalot and less of a creative menace or goalscoring threat than the unfairly maligned Casemiro might have been. Rashford, and then Hojlund, couldn&rsquo;t hold the ball up or link up the play like Zirkzee did. But by then our shape had gone and Palace were on top.</p>
<p>Lucky to come away with a draw in the end, thanks to an incredible double save from Onana and wasteful finishing from Eze, although we should have won the game in the first half an hour.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the good old days, football was a simple game. You had eleven players and a substitute numbered 1 to 12, no shirt advertising, a referee and two linesmen, a manager, a trainer, a physio, a scout or two, tea ladies, drinking culture, long hair and perms, the club chairman, a board of directors, a club secretary, a groundsman, a stadium in the beating heart of the town or city, fans, standing room only, electric atmospheres, matches on Saturday at three o&rsquo;clock, live coverage on the radio, match reports in the Pink Final after the game, and highlights on Match of the Day at 10:30 the same night. Tradition and history.</p>
<p>These days, it&rsquo;s big business. You&rsquo;ve got a hundred players in the first team squad, shirt number bingo sponsored by online sports betting companies, the reserves, the academy, a women&rsquo;s team, out on loan, transfer windows, exiled due to poor man-management, five, seven, nine subs to choose from, a referee and a substitute referee, assistant refs, refs sat in an office in a business park (a clear and obvious error), refs at home, refs in the studio, refs in the crowd, a manager, a head coach, a goalkeeping coach, various other specialist coaches, multitudes of doctors, physios, psychologists, data analysts, worldwide scouting networks, dieticians, head chefs, gambling addictions, agents, chief executives, directors of football, technical directors, presidents of business, heads of legal, heads of state, matches at any time from noon to after the last train home, an advertiser&rsquo;s stadium out of town, sitting room only, live streaming all day and all night. Profit and sustainability.</p>
<p>At one time, a manager of a football club could expect to run all aspects of the club to a lesser or greater degree, or at least have a major say in how it was run. Nowadays, managers, or coaches, are often restricted to, well, coaching players in training and on match days, and speaking to the media before and after games. They are seen as specialists rather than all-rounders, and more specialists from the world of corporate finance are brought in to fire the tea ladies and keep the manager - sorry, coach - fully focused on his job and not get distracted by wheeling and dealing in the transfer market, player contracts, or appealing points deductions for spending beyond the club&rsquo;s means.</p>
<h1 id="united">United</h1>
<p>Indeed, this is how United plc&rsquo;s Dan Ashworth keeps Eric ten Hag successful on the pitch. Oh, wait. I&rsquo;m no fan in particular of Jamie Carragher, but he might have had a point when described United last season as one of the most poorly coached sides in the Premier League. United&rsquo;s usual set up is a chaotic mismatch of players out of form, out of position, out of confidence, and out of luck. Individual errors rule the day, and most of the players look lost and like they&rsquo;d rather be in the physio room or gambling rehab. We rely totally on one player - Bruno - to create chances and score. This is a colossal failure of recruitment, of management, of coaching, of captaincy, of teamwork.</p>
<p>Fergie took six seasons to win the title after twenty six years of hurt, and three seasons after winning the cup in 1990. His team often looked like it wasn&rsquo;t making any progress, but the cup win did see a consistent marked improvement season on season (13th to 6th to 2nd to 1st). Ten Hag produced a masterful cup win against all the odds, although perhaps City&rsquo;s players were caught off guard expecting an easy win after United&rsquo;s lucky semi-final win against Coventry. Every season Pep has them playing in a clearly identifiable system and is never afraid to switch players or tactics.</p>
<h1 id="ingerland">Ingerland</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to hear Morgan Gibbs-White talk about Ingerland&rsquo;s new interim manager Lee Carsley and describe his qualities as basically being a father-figure. Most top-level professional footballers are with their clubs from the age of eight, and likely spend more time than most kids away from their families and any normal childhood - living the dream, nonetheless. You can understand why they would value this kind of man-management, someone who will stick up for them no matter what.</p>
<p>Ten Hag hasn&rsquo;t got that about him at all. He&rsquo;s lost a whole load of players in one way or another because he didn&rsquo;t have the heart or the head or the guts to stand by them when they needed him. De Gea, Maguire, Wan Bissaka, Casemiro, McTominay, Sancho, Antony, Martial, Rashford, Greenwood.</p>
<p>The spineless corporate bosses meanwhile took an age to decide the safest bet was to keep ten Hag. Failure is expected and gives them half a season at least to bed themselves in and some new players, too, in time for a new manager. If he does well, then they made the right decision. If they had appointed a new manager he might have failed, too, with the current players, and that would have reflected badly on the corporate bosses.</p>
<p>At least we&rsquo;re not Chelsea. Telling your captain that he&rsquo;s not technically good enough. Successfully scraping through the play-off round of the Conference League. Moneyball gone mad (although they could have a decent team in three seasons&hellip;).</p>

<p>(Un)fortunately, as I sat down to type the words from my fingertips, my four year old decided <em>he</em> needed to express <em>his</em> thoughts instead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously not to scale (he&rsquo;s only four!), but you can clearly see the Labour supermajority in red, and the Tory wipeout in blue. That they are a &lsquo;uniparty&rsquo;/two cheeks of the same backside is encapsulated in the red triangle atop the blue square in the centre.</p>
<p>The Green surge in vote share (in green, on the left) isn&rsquo;t reflected in seats won, of course. In pink, you can see the rise of the independents, black is the Workers Party, and to the far right (in grey) is Reform.</p>
<p>The Lib Dems are an irrelevance (except in the South West) in yellow (this is where we had to stop, as he got very upset at the lack of orange).</p>

			 <p>Ealing Genocide Supporters Club (aka Ealing Labour Party) held their Southall Branch meeting yesterday at the Dominion Centre in Southall. Under the guise of a &ldquo;Your Town, Your Voice&rdquo; community get together, our local elected repellents gathered on masse in all their finery. I couldn&rsquo;t help myself as they posed for a group photo all gurning inanely as the photographer encouraged them to &ldquo;say cheese!&rdquo;. &ldquo;Say genocide!&rdquo; I offered. &ldquo;Genocide supporters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cllr Dr Murtaza of their number aggressively reprimanded me. &ldquo;What evidence do you have that we support genocide?&rdquo; he demanded to know. Well, I told him, my main piece of evidence would be that you have done nothing to oppose it.</p>
<p>Ooh! There&rsquo;s Cllr Martin! Our locally elected anti-Traveller racist! &ldquo;What evidence do you have to support that?&rdquo; Well, <a href="https://skwawkbox.org/2022/02/14/party-imposed-london-council-candidate-used-holocaust-language-against-gypsy-roma-travellers/">here</a> it is.</p>
<p>Oh, and while you&rsquo;re at it, Cllr Dr Murtaza. Next time you are chauffeuring our glorious leader around in your Porsche, try not to <a href="https://twitter.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1587711673942646785?t=U0luZmPHCxRb9wGAC5Ffkw&amp;s=19">park in a cycle lane</a>, please.</p>
<p>Then there was illegal samosa factory proprietor Cllr <a href="https://sadealing.blogspot.com/2010_10_03_archive.html?m=1">&ldquo;I own half of Southall&rdquo;</a> Anand.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t realised until yesterday quite how visceral my revulsion for these people is. The grand <a href="https://ealing.nub.news/news/local-news/former-ealing-council-housing-leader-admits-he-39made-a-mistake39-accepting-3000-from-developer-for-cannes-property-conference">cuckoo in the nest</a> arrived about half way through the event. I would have confronted him myself, and previously I have done. Maybe I was just worn down from a week with the &lsquo;flu, but I felt like I really had to keep my distance for my own sanity. In any case, a few council officers made beelines for me and made sure I was busy answering their questions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, one officer suggested to me that resident-led ward forums would be the likely outcome of this event. Fantastic news, if that&rsquo;s the case. Another officer I spoke to later, knew nothing about this idea, though, but took copious notes. A neighbour and friend told me that she spoke to the cuckoo himself who told her that this meeting was in fact the replacement for he old (councillor-led) ward forums. That&rsquo;s that then.</p>
<p>The event itself was a repeat of several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040615012717/http://www.southallgasworks.com/Media/ConsultationReport.pdf">resident</a>[pdf] <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/6838/southall_shaping_ealing_summary">surveys</a> and <a href="https://www.visitsouthall.co.uk/News/NewsDetails.php?recordID=1006">failed</a> <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/6999/southall_reset_%E2%80%93_spatial_planning_framework">plans</a> over the past twenty years or so (for which I&rsquo;ve seen records, or taken part in). The problems are always the same. The responses from the council are always the same. Nothing.</p>

			 <p>I spent the best part of nine months in America in 1989-90 on an international student exchange programme. It was an experience I&rsquo;ll never forget, mostly good, and certainly an eye opener.</p>
<p>There was a bit of a last minute faff getting my visa (I had misunderstood the requirements) and by the time I got to Gatwick Airport I was shitting bricks, having never flown or been abroad before. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Pan-Am-flight-103">Lockerbie</a> was also still fresh in the memory.</p>
<p>The plane I was on just happened to be Virgin Atlantic&rsquo;s inaugural flight from Gatwick to JFK, and so we had the unpleasure of Richard Branson sexually assaulting us in stockings and suspenders to celebrate.</p>
<p>On arrival in the US, I had no clue what to do other than to get a &ldquo;limousine&rdquo; to Farmington, CT, and then a taxi from there. I had my dime for the phone call ready.</p>
<p>The limousine was a coach, and we arrived in a deserted Farlington coach terminal at 2 am. I found a phone booth, put in my dime and called a taxi. The operator couldn&rsquo;t help me and hung up. There goes my dime! Why didn&rsquo;t I have a Plan B dime? Fuck! Somehow, I managed to call another taxi and got to my student digs on campus at CCSU in New Britain.</p>
<p>It all felt utterly surreal to me then, like being stranded on another planet, adrift in my bunk bed, alone in the halls of a spacecraft, listening to the crickets and the ghostly sounds of train horns.
From the initial induction for international students - &ldquo;Americans can be outwardly incredibly friendly to strangers, and will almost certainly invite you to come to their house anytime for dinner. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t go! They won&rsquo;t be expecting you!&rdquo; - to the <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/1989/11/09/big-in-america.html">imposing vastness of the country and people</a>, I was warned to expect <em>culture shock</em>.</p>
<p>Everything was big to me then, which meant that I felt small and insignificant. I found it hard to adapt and got so homesick that I booked a flight home for Xmas and New Year just to see my family and friends again. I didn&rsquo;t really want to go back afterwards.</p>
<p>But I had already had some amazing experiences. My roommate, Mark, was totally into active outdoor life and we went climbing locally at Ragged Mountain, which was an exhilarating first for me climbing to the top of a cliff. Then we set up a ridiculously ambitious plan to <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/1989/12/04/the-colorado-trail.html">climb Long&rsquo;s Peak in the Colorado Rockies</a> during the Thanksgiving holiday. We failed because we got hit by what was thankfully just a two day a blizzard as we set up our tents at basecamp. Once safely back down and showered, we had a massive breakfast at Ed&rsquo;s Cantina in Estes Park the next morning before going skiing (another death-defying first for me).</p>
<p>Mark is still cycling, skiing, hiking and living off his memories of later climbing Mount Everest while selling toilets to pay for it all (which is funny in itself as I have never met anyone who can fart and burp constantly like he did back then). Mark&rsquo;s wilderness pal Mike is still in the wilderness, and is now also a published author on the significance and synchronicity of owls as messengers from other worlds or dimensions in time and space.</p>
<p>We regularly ate at Pizza World in Farmington, where they made the biggest and best spinach and ricotta calzones. We drank pitchers of beer at Elmer&rsquo;s, and got free slices of fresh pizza every evening at 10:30.</p>
<p>I trained with the Blue Devils&rsquo; soccer team (with one eye on getting fit for our Colorado expedition), and made number 26 (out of 11) on the team, which featured multiple Geordie, Irish, and European failed pros on soccer scholarships, and coached by a Geordie and an ex-Bristol City player.</p>
<p>A group of us Internationals set up a satirical student magazine (<em>A Connecticut Wanker</em>) produced on a very early Apple Macintosh computer.</p>
<p>I even got to have a go on the student radio one morning and played <em>Fools Gold</em> by Stone Roses to our mystery audience.</p>
<p>That reminds me, <a href="https://social.ayjay.org/2024/05/08/rip-steve-albini.html">Steve Albini&rsquo;s untimely death yesterday</a> - when I got back to the UK, I tried to get involved in the student union magazine and wrote a condemnatory piece about the naming of Albini&rsquo;s new band <em>Rapeman</em>. I got slaughtered by the hipster editorial team for being unhip and not being into <em>Marmalade</em>, and I held a grudge against Albini ever since (despite grudgingly enjoying his work as a producer). So it was with mixed feelings that I read yesterday that he had recently noted the error of his ways as a young man and sought to hold his hands up and acknowledge his white male privilege.</p>
<p>When I somewhat reluctantly returned to the states in January, I ended up having such a blast I didn&rsquo;t want to leave when my visa expired and tried (and failed) to get a new one so I could stay and work.
We did more skiing (in Killington, Vermont), and watched Nelson Mandela walk free on the hotel TV. (Almost exactly thirteen years later, I watched in shock and awe as the US bombed Baghdad back to the Stone Age on the hotel TV while on a skiing trip in France).</p>
<p>We did Spring Break in Miami, and the Florida Keys, but especially Key West.</p>
<p>We took a road trip to New Orleans via the Appalachian Trail, Memphis and the Mississippi.
And we finished off with a road trip delivering a car from Boston to LA, taking in the Mesa Verde, and the Grand Canyon, along the way.</p>
<p>We did day trips to New York and Washington, DC.</p>
<p>When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; in all of the above, we were a group of international students, quite a few of us English, but with some French, German, Italian, Cypriot, Bangladeshi and Canadian people in the group, too. Not everyone went on every trip, but I did.</p>
<p>We split up in Santa Monica as my two travelling companions wanted to go to San Diego, while I wanted to go to San Francisco (and I had run out of money, so my plan was to get a flight back to New Britain from there, and then on to my flight home to the UK). I ended up literally walking around San Francisco for a week with no money and staying in the cheapest hostel I could find. I spent quite a bit of time sitting on the dock of the bay looking at Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>One memory that always stuck in my mind was talking to a business professor at CCSU. I think I had signed up for his class before quickly dropping it because he insisted on too many formalities in his classroom that I felt had nothing to do with learning or even business (although what do I know about the latter?). Anyway, for some reason I can&rsquo;t remember, this professor ended up explaining to me just how fearful, and loathing, and downright paranoid he was about unAmericans who - in his words - were &ldquo;all out to get us&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really understand it then, I was just left gobsmacked that anyone could really feel like that in the richest and most powerful country in the world. But on the other hand, I knew that most of the Americans I had met had never travelled beyond their state borders, and never learned anything of the world outside of the US, and mostly were solely concerned with getting their degrees while having one massive keg party. A surprising (to me) number of female students were already married (or engaged to be married), and all wore so much make-up on a daily basis it&rsquo;s like they were auditioning for Real Housewives sixteen years before it aired on TV.</p>
<p>The Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza and a recent <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/05/09/zionism-is-rooted.html">quote from a Jewish man born and raised into Zionist culture</a> made me think about my paranoid professor and his <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/1989/11/09/multicultural-societies.html">culturally repressed students and the American people more generally</a>, as it is the United States of America that is paying for and arming Israel. The US is, of course, founded by religious extremists fleeing persecution in their homelands, and who then inflicted genocide on the native American peoples as they colonised and settled on their lands. It&rsquo;s a white European, male supremacist culture, very similar to Zionism, so it&rsquo;s really no wonder the two are inextricably allied.</p>

			 <p>Along with thirty-odd other parents, I saw my nine year old off on his big adventure this morning, a school trip away to Wales for three nights. Everyone was super excited and nervous, and so were the kids.</p>
<p>The teachers accompanying them were super-organised. We&rsquo;d had several in-person meetings prior, as well as countless <em>Dojo</em> messages and crumpled lists stuffed into school backpacks telling what to pack and what not to bring.</p>
<p>One teacher checked all the kids into the school hall and gave everyone an identifying number to stick on their top. Another checked in all the sealed and named daily medication bags. A third handed out school prepared packed lunches. A fourth mingled giving out reassurances as required.</p>
<p>The coach arrived on time, and the teacher who handed out the numbered stickers announced that children would go to the bus in groups of five according to the names and numbers he read out - a bit like child bingo. Everyone put their suitcase in the hold and carried their backpack and themselves on to the bus. Finally they were all ready to go!</p>
<p>Mingling teacher then asked if anyone needed to go to the toilet before they set off, and I swear thirty-odd kids all got off the bus and went an did their last minute business before (hopefully) all getting back on board. A quick hand count (&ldquo;only raise <em>one</em> hand each&rdquo;), and the coach drove out of the school grounds to waves and sobs from parents.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, little Abdul emerged from the boys toilet&hellip; (well, I didn&rsquo;t hang around to see that, I just hope that didn&rsquo;t happen).</p>

<p>What Marxism teaches us is simply to approach questions of society from a material basis: how does human life persist? Through production of the goods and services needed to live.</p>
<p>How are these things produced under capitalist society? Through exploitation of the labor of the working class, that is, by requiring one class of people to sell their labor as a commodity to another class to produce values.</p>
<p>What is the result of this system? That workers are “alienated” from their labor, meaning from much of their waking life, constantly required to produce more and more with an ever-precarious access to the means of subsistence.</p>

<hr>
<p>Jim had lost his coat.</p>
<p>He remembered leaving it in the Halfway House pub next to the entrance to the Southall football ground on Western Road.</p>
<p>He told me he lived in neighbouring Hayes with his wife, who would be very angry with him if he went home without his coat.</p>
<p>He also had a house in Ireland.</p>
<p>We walked and walked, but we couldn&rsquo;t find the Halfway House. It was neither here nor there. We couldn&rsquo;t find the football ground, either. Nothing was where Jim remembered it.</p>
<p>Like his coat, they were very much alive in Jim&rsquo;s memory, but in the world we walked in the goalposts had literally moved, the final whistle had blown, and everyone had gone home, except Jim (and me).</p>
<p>I felt very confused. Finally it dawned on me that Jim was probably feeling very confused, too. And probably very frightened. He asked if I could show him the way to get the bus back to Hayes, which I did.</p>
<p>We never did find his coat.</p>

			 <p>My nine year old started keeping a journal at school so we can read what he&rsquo;s been doing at school every day. (Replaces the &ldquo;What did you do at school today?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t remember&rdquo; alternative). It&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>He wanted to know what I&rsquo;ve been doing, too, so I am reciprocating. I&rsquo;ve never kept a diary a journal before, but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed doing it these past couple of days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say, though, that my lad&rsquo;s days are far more interesting and fun than mine.</p>

<p>To get him into the bath tonight, I tried something new.</p>
<p>I got on all fours so he could ride me like a horse into the bathroom while I hummed the <a href="https://youtu.be/AnNKsk2a0fI?si=kGOW__Njq2oSTUnY">theme tune to The Lone Ranger</a>. He dismounted, undressed and climbed in without any bother.</p>

			 <p>These are my last words writing from the café at the local leisure centre where I go every Wednesday during term time as a parent <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/09/29/human-shield.html">volunteer</a> for my son&rsquo;s swimming class. It&rsquo;s their final session today.</p>
<p>My lad has gone from being so <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/02/noodle.html">anxious about swimming</a> that he didn&rsquo;t want to go at all, to wanting to go for swimming lessons now the class sessions are over.</p>
<p>The café that was closed has reopened, although I still haven&rsquo;t bought anything. They have new tables and chairs, too, which is nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been something a personal journey for me, too. Having an hour or so in relatively undisturbed peace and quiet just to write whatever comes into my head (and publish to my <a href="micro.blog/davidmarsden">micro.blog</a>) has felt very therapeutic. I feel like something significant has changed within me, for the better.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say what, exactly, for a number of reasons, not in public. Maybe another time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also wondering if it&rsquo;s a permanent change, or if it will all unravel. And I&rsquo;m also feeling some sense of loss. Something that has been a part of me for a long time has gone. Even though it had an overall bad effect on my life, it was a regular companion. It won&rsquo;t be missed, exactly, but it takes some getting used to, it not being here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to find somewhere else to write.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Having been so bitterly <a href="thehttps://davidmarsden.info/2023/12/08/curriculum-vitae-hocus.html">rejected both in love and at work</a>, I started to look around for new opportunities. I don&rsquo;t remember how I found it, but a nursing home nearer to where I lived at the time (Cleethorpes) was advertising for a <em>Therapeutic Activities Co-ordinator</em> to develop a range of meaningful activities with frail elderly people who also had - iirc - impaired memory, or dementia. Right up my street (well, just around the corner).</p>
<p>This was the first time in my life (I was thirty years old) that I&rsquo;d ever actually wanted a job, and I was determined to make sure I did everything I possibly could to get it (the money was better, too, although not a great deal). I think I really impressed them at the interview with the presentation I did (probably bullet points, but that was all the rage back then), but more my genuine enthusiasm and excitement at the prospect of doing what, at the time, seemed like it would be my &ldquo;dream job&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The role was to cover three separate nursing and residential homes in the Grimsby, Cleethorpes and Humberston area, all quite different as it turned out. I would also liaise with a colleague in Hull (where the company that ran the care homes had its headquarters), who had already been in post in his area for a year or so. Steve was a social worker by trade, and he was very upset to discover that I was not. He was also agitating for a substantial pay rise, and later on we would jointly present our case to the board of directors.</p>
<p>I shadowed Steve for a day or two and wrote substantial notes and reflections, before setting up my desk on the landing of the first floor next to the lift and the payphone (yes, really) at <em>The Anchorage</em> just up the road from Blundell Park. When I first entered The Anchorage it was a shock to the system. I was used to a welcoming, friendly, clean, freshly smelling (as much as possible), professional, and lively residential home where I used to work. The Anchorage was anything but. There was no welcome, staff looked harried, the place was so obviously run down and uncared for, it stank of piss, and all the residents appeared to be fully comatose.</p>
<p>That was on the ground floor. Upstairs was slightly better - at least the residents were awake. But it was like a madhouse, and brought back traumatic memories of a childhood school visit to the local mental hospital to sing Christmas carols to the moaning, leering, grabbing, drooling <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inmates<!-- raw HTML omitted -->patients. The only redeeming factor now was that none of the inmates seemed able to move. I was going to have my work cut out here.</p>
<p>I think my boss expected me to have a timetable of bingo sessions, sing-a-longs, tea dances, quiz nights, etc. up and running straight away. But I would have to raise the dead first, and persuade the staff and manager to be supportive and helpful, In fact, a complete change of culture was needed. I spent several weeks getting to know everyone, not only there, but at the other two homes as well. One of the others was much larger with what seemed like a highly mobile group of very demented residents, while the other was more of a mixture of demented and simply frail elderly people. Once I got to know everyone, The Anchorage seemed to be mostly people with physical health problems, often compounded by the effects of a stroke.</p>
<p>The other two homes also had good, strong supportive managers, while The Anchorage had a temporary manager (one of the senior nurses), before appointing an absolute horror of a woman who mercilessly bullied me and made my job much more difficult than it needed to be. Luckily, most of the nurses and carers were good people.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, we raised the dead. It turns out (who knew?) that even very poorly, very old people are up for conversation, doing things that interest them, socialising, going out, singing, dancing, moving, learning to walk again, reminiscing, and just living what life there is left. But they need help to do so. And when they get the help they need to do some or all of these things, it also turns out that they are often more continent, can walk again, need less of the carers&rsquo; and nurses&rsquo; time for personal care, feel better, have better health, and - crucially from the business point of view - live longer.</p>
<p>And when the residents are happier, have something to get up for, and are easier to look after, the staff are happier, too. We had a lot of fun. It was amazing. A highlight was organising three coaches and a disability-friendly minibus to take every resident from all three homes literally around the corner form The Anchorage to <em>The Excel Club</em>, which was (in the good old days), the premier night spot and bar for many of &ldquo;my people&rdquo; when they were young, for an afternoon of drinking, dancing, eating, socialising and reminiscing that I won&rsquo;t forget (even if many of them them had forgotten by the time they got home).</p>
<p>The beauty of the whole endeavour was that people needing care were no longer seen as tasks to be performed and checked off on a list, but as people who had lives, stories, senses of humour, wants and needs like everyone else.</p>
<p>Such a great thing could obviously have no future, and when me and Steve presented the business case for expansion and pay rises to the board it was rejected outright. The most helpful training I ever did was with a trainer who advised me &ldquo;don&rsquo;t waste time trying to persuade people who aren&rsquo;t interested - focus on those who are.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d tried my best, I really had. While I did really enjoy the job, I didn&rsquo;t want to be doing the same thing week after week, year after year, with no prospect of advancement and for a company that clearly wasn&rsquo;t interested or appreciative.</p>
<p>I started looking around again, and this time further afield. I felt I was in a rut, personally as well (it was all work and no play for me), and I needed a fresh start.</p>

			 <p>My son&rsquo;s school&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.thriveapproach.com/services/schools-and-academies/primary-schools">Thrive</a> teacher is leaving. She helped transform my lad&rsquo;s experience of school from being one where he had weekly if not daily challenges with regulating his emotions and his behaviour, to one where he enjoys school every day. She&rsquo;s going to be very greatly missed.</p>
<p>I managed to tell her this today and thank her for her work. It was so sad to hear her story.</p>
<p>She has committed ten years of her life to helping our youngsters get the best start in life, and done lots of extra work getting accredited to do so. But, at the end of the day, she can no longer afford to continue, and has taken a job elsewhere in sales and marketing.</p>
<p>What a stupid, shit country we live in.</p>

			 <p>Inevitably, <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/11/30/curriculum-vitae-ad.html">my time as a Manchester University player</a> came to end, and I left the club by mutual consent when my contract ended.</p>
<p>Somewhat bizarrely, looking back on it, I joined what appeared to be an obscure and tiny religious cult in the middle of nowhere (deepest, darkest Lincolnshire), dabbling in some rather questionable <em>therapy</em> / witchcraft.</p>
<p>My role was primarily as <em>Administrator</em> with responsibility for making sense of the almost entirely lacking paperwork, contracts, and financial arrangements of the company (?) / sole practitioner / lead sorceress. Bed and board were included in my pay, which meant I didn&rsquo;t get paid much at all, and had to do a <em>lot</em> of household chores on a strict rota, along with the other, er, <em>residents</em>.</p>
<p>I got kicked out about six months later for dropping acid at the weekend. Somehow, with a couple of band mates, we cleaned ourselves up and managed to persuade a friendly estate agent to rent us out a four-bedroomed semi-detached house that had one careful previous owner (the local vicar), that was ideally located opposite a big pub and just up the road from the local drug dealers.</p>
<p>We spent eighteen months there, mostly on the dole, getting our musical act into gear. Completely by chance (we put up a card in the local Spa shop window asking for a &ldquo;chilled out lamppost&rdquo;), we met a nomadic (on the run) alcoholic junkie who could actually sing, write songs, and also played a mean guitar. We rehearsed every day in that house (pity our poor neighbours), <a href="https://www.bandlab.com/davidmarsden/albums/634277cd-d288-ef11-8471-000d3a930775">recorded</a> a couple of decent demo tapes (<a href="https://www.bandlab.com/davidmarsden/albums/e3c6b0ef-d188-ef11-8471-000d3a930775">got to number one</a> in the local newspaper charts), and played some wild gigs that were generally pretty well received.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The end was nigh, though, as it always is. I&rsquo;d got a job to help pay for gear, and fell madly in love with one of my new co-workers. Euro 96 appeared, and we all took a break from music to enjoy <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2014/06/03/a-new-ingerland.html">Ing-er-land&rsquo;s latest heartbreak efforts</a>. Our junkie friend wasn&rsquo;t into football, or staying around, and one day he was gone. My love interest left, too.</p>
<p>This was the catalyst for me to focus on work for the first time in my life, as a coping mechanism for loss, as much as anything else. The more I worked, the less loss I felt. I couldn&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p>
<p>I started at the bottom. Literally. The job I applied for was <em>Personal Carer</em> in a <em>Residential Home</em>. I assumed that it meant psychological care, and didn&rsquo;t pay much attention on my first morning shift when I shadowed another carer who was wiping bottom after bottom (and more) of all these frail, elderly folks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got into it (and my new co-worker), and found that, yes, there was a quite a degree of psychological care involved, too, if you had the time, skills and inclination. Unbelievably (or so it seemed to many in the <em>industry</em> at the time, when frail, elderly people find they have something worth living for (a friend to talk to, something fun to do, something like a day out to look forward to), they&rsquo;re much more capable of getting themselves dressed, feeding themselves, staying continent.</p>
<p>Of course, many carers had none of those things, and in fact, got very little psychological care themselves in their own lives. Often it was just a continuation of the <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/12/06/teachers.html">sadistic brutality from their school days</a>.</p>
<p>But I found myself actually enjoying the job despite the low pay, and often quite unpleasant working conditions. I enjoyed the people - the camaraderie and comradeship of the staff and residents. We really were all in it together</p>
<p>That said, there was only so much arse wiping I could do before I got fed up with it. I&rsquo;d done everything and more I&rsquo;d been asked to do and applied to be a <em>Senior Carer</em> and even a <em>Care Services Manager</em> (responsible for running the shifts, and the home in the absence of the Home Manager). But I wasn&rsquo;t successful - too little experience, I was told. Which might have been true. I&rsquo;d only been there a year.</p>
<p>But I suspect it might also have been because I was too much of a threat to the darker side of what was going on. The manager was taking money from at least one of the more severely demented residents, and some of the staff were in on it, too. At least, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d been told.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday morning, I was sat in the foyer of my little kid&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s centre waiting for the staff to arrive so he could start his day. He was eager to get in, banging on the locked doors to the main part of the nursery. In my day, the kids would be trying to get out, not in.</p>
<p>Some other parents, younger than me, commented the same. Everyone recounted some particularly, sadistic child-hating teacher who regularly brutalised them or some other poor unfortunate during their formative years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re lucky that teachers today seem to be so much friendlier, and supportive, and tolerant of differences and behavioural challenges. And generally just miles better teachers and humans.</p>
<p>There were exceptions, of course. I had one teacher in particular, who would have fitted right in with contemporary teachers (although probably not, actually, as he was a bit of a contrarian). But he was a great teacher, loved kids, and dedicated his life to teaching.</p>
<p>It always amazes me, though, when I see old school friends on Facebook reminiscing about some teacher we had, about how wonderful they were. Most of them were drunken bullies, whose hobbies revolved around making kids miserable and causing physical and mental harm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be locked up now.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I spent most of my three years <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/11/24/curriculum-vitae-ad.html">&lsquo;working&rsquo; in Manchester</a> down the pub. When I was in my shared smoke-filled office, I was more often than not playing a very early demo of football manager (four free seasons, on repeat), or compiling a regular comedy fanzine for the five-a-side footy team I helped to found and run. They were crazy and fun times.</p>
<p>Every other weekend, I got a train back to Lincolnshire for band rehearsals, recordings and occasional gigs. Although these were more often than not simply excuses to drink to excess.</p>
<p>I forget how much I was being paid, but it seemed like a fortune (it wasn&rsquo;t, but life was free and easy back then).
My boss Terry was a quietly manic Irish gynaecologist who had somehow ended up leading European studies into vertebral osteoporosis. He had more faith in me than I had in myself. He would type things on to the computer screen and ask me to read them. I would say things like, &ldquo;You need to slow down, mate. Use some spaces and punctuation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My main role was to input response rate data, which consisted of reams of handwritten register books from all over Europe containing names, gender, dates of birth, and what kind of fracture they had suffered, if any, and if they responded to our survey, or not. Thrilling work.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I got to go to a couple of conferences (excuses to drink to excess) in Bath and Prague. I remember watching Ireland beat Italy in the 1994 World Cup with a bunch of Italian bone doctors in Bath. And we stayed in a stereotypical concrete skyscraper communist-era hotel-cum-conference centre on the outskirts of Prague, but had enough free time to explore the gothic city centre in the midst of a wintry, thundery snowstorm while drinking Czech vodka.</p>
<p>As what felt like a last resort to motivate me, my boss sent me on a week long working holiday to Athens. My objective was imply to visit one of the research centres there and make sure they knew how to complete the response rate registers correctly. A two hour job, as it turned out. They sent me for a week, as it was cheaper than sending me for a day or an overnighter, flights only, I had to find somewhere to stay when I got there.
When I arrived in the heart of Athens and got out of my airport taxi, I stumbled on to the street trying to catch my bearings. A &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; local &rsquo;took pity&rsquo; on my and asked me where I was from. &ldquo;Manchester&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Aha! Bobby Chalton! Nobby Sti-les! Come! Come! I have a bar! I will get you a drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I walked into his dimly lit bar just around the corner. I bottle of cold beer was waiting for me. So friendly and welcoming! As my eyes became accustomed to the light, I looked around to take in my surroundings. A group of scantily clad young (and not so young) women giggled at a table opposite the bar. Red lights everywhere! I made my excuses and left!</p>
<p>After doing my two hours work, I spent the rest of the week walking all around the old town and seeing all the ancient sites by day, and drinking to excess in the evenings.</p>

			 <p>After <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/11/17/curriculum-vitae-repetitum.html">failing to become the next George Harrison</a>, I spent three years idling around, getting into trouble, and generally not knowing what to do with myself.</p>
<p>I had some summer jobs working on a local farm stacking straw bales on to lorries from Cockermouth, feeding turkeys, and working in the grain barn (doing what I can&rsquo;t remember, although I do remember not being able to breathe because of all the dust).</p>
<p>I remember one day my car broke down, leaving me and my baling partner stranded in a field in the middle of nowhere. It was a very second hand Mini Cooper, which ultimately failed its MoT when the <em>papier mâché</em> the previous careful owner had used to fill the side panel caught fire while the mechanic was welding something (it&rsquo;s a long time ago, and I never understood how cars work, partly thanks to my Physics teacher, who told all the boys to leave his class on &ldquo;how cars work&rdquo; because, obviously, being boys, we already knew).</p>
<p>Anyway, the farmer kindly gave us a lift home. On the way, he told us he would deduct the petrol money (£5 each) from our wages. Now in those days, £5 was quite a lot of money, certainly enough to get royally drunk on at the weekend and still have enough for a bag of chips from the Chinese takeaway afterwards.</p>
<p>I also worked some summers in the plastics factory my mum worked at. She, and the other local mums made children&rsquo;s play clothes, while the local children put poles into windbreaks to make sitting on the local beaches bearable in the face of the North Sea winds.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that there must be something wrong with me, and so I decided to go to University to study psychology and find a fix.</p>
<p>In order to get into Uni, I needed a better &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level result than me three Es from school, so I did a correspondence course in Law and got a B. I could have gone to Manchester Polytechnic, but instead elected to go to Bolton Institute of Higher Education. I was really too terrified to go to Manchester Poly (too big, too big city centre). Christ, I was even terrified of getting on the train (not knowing how or where to buy a ticket, how to know which train to get on, how to know when to get off, etc.).</p>
<p>Manchester appealed because it was where my dad hailed from (well, Oldham, really, although he went to school in Manchester, and, of course, went to Old Trafford to watch Best, Law and Charlton in their heyday).</p>
<p>Bolton was interesting and fun, though, and I made some good friends there, got a 2:1 degree, spent a year in the US on an exchange programme where I did several road trips across the country, climbed a mountain, nearly died in a blizzard, skied down other mountains, made no. 26 on the University Soccer Team, among other things.</p>
<p>In my first semester in the states, I was terribly homesick and made an unscheduled visit home for Christmas and New Year. When I went back, I got into the experience so much I wanted to stay, but couldn&rsquo;t get a job or visa to do so.</p>
<p>When I finished my degree, I was hopelessly lost again with know idea what to do. My degree had taught me (wrongly, imo) that psychological problems were contained wholly within the individual person and could be treated by taking lots of drugs (not that I was against that, at all). My careers advisor helpfully counselled that I could do anything I wanted to do as long as it wasn&rsquo;t psychology (for which I&rsquo;d need a medical degree). I half-heartedly applied to do a Masters degree, but the thought of more constrained studying wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted (I wanted money to buy drugs).</p>
<p>So, with friends, I got a summer job with an employment agency picking orders in an old cotton mill converted into a warehouse in Shaw. We supplemented the permanent staff, who could mostly be found sleeping in dens hidden inside a maze of boxes, and so had to work twice as hard for a fraction of the pay without any benefits of regular employment like sick pay, holidays, etc. Or in our case, as it turned out, no pay at all, at least until I led a delegation of workers to confront the hapless recruitment agent.</p>
<p>I quit that job, and looked around for work. I remember going to an interview in leafy Stockport (or maybe it was Wilmslow) or somewhere &ldquo;down south&rdquo; for some kind of &ldquo;trainee manager&rdquo; job. There were a lot them about at the time. While I was waiting to go in, I saw and heard all the staff gather for what appeared to be their regular morning meeting, where they began chanting some bizarre marketing cult bullshit. I made my excuses and ran for my life.</p>
<p>I signed up, instead, as a &ldquo;trainee manager&rdquo; for Domino&rsquo;s Pizza at their franchise in Swinton. I lasted six weeks, although it felt like longer. I worked 80 hour weeks for £80 a week and all the leftover pizza I could eat. My <em>nadir</em> was a Saturday night when I found myself left alone in charge of the shop and unable to cope. I was never the fastest at making the fast food. In those days, Domino&rsquo;s promised to deliver within 40 minutes of your order or you get it for free. Once I got behind, it was impossible to catch up. On this night I swear people were phoning their friends saying, &ldquo;Free pizza at Domino&rsquo;s! It&rsquo;ll be stone cold when you get it, but hey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dad threatened to get me a job in the pea processing plant where he was now a supervisor back in Grimsby, and while I ended up moving back with him I worked in a high street burger bar called <em>Yankees</em> (I called it <em>Wankers</em>) instead. Why? I don&rsquo;t know, because I was clearly unsuited to the frenetic, frantic pace of the work, and dealing with drunken customers in the early hours of a Saturday or Sunday morning. I remember chasing a group of youths down the street with a carving knife after they squirted ketchup all over my nice clean shop walls. Wankers!</p>
<p>Along with my best friend at Uni, I applied for a job at Manchester University as a Research Assistant. I was terrible at interviews then, while he breezed it. I was absolutely gutted, and couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Then, out of the blue a few weeks later, my mate called me to tell me they had a job for me. So back I went. I spent three years researching nothing at all, but thoroughly enjoying living the life in Manchester city centre, with all that entailed, in the early 90s.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s my 365 day &lsquo;anniversary&rsquo; on micro.blog.</p>
<p>When I moved here last year, it was in the wake of the X-ification of Twitter, the exodus to Mastodon, and generally wanting to start blogging/writing again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on Twitter/X, and left Mastodon to move. I did start blogging a bit more to begin with, but that soon tailed off to nothing, as it always does.</p>
<p>I did try to interact with the micro.blog community, and I follow quite a few people here and find their posts interesting enough to <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/bookmarked/">bookmark</a> on a regular basis.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t really looking for community, or even interaction particularly. More a place to keep in touch with a few old identi.ca/Mastodon friends, and have my own place on the web.</p>
<p>My recent new <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/09/29/human-shield.html">volunteering role</a> has meant I have a regular time and space to write, and I realise now that what&rsquo;s important (as everyone who writes always says), is simply to write (and publish). Nothing&rsquo;s ever finished or perfect, and it doesn&rsquo;t need to be. Very few (external) links or photos, or anything that isn&rsquo;t writing.</p>
<p>And I like it.</p>

			 <p>ToryBoy The Movie is the account of filmmaker John Walsh&rsquo;s disillusionment with what he saw as the corruption, lies, hypocrisy and general incompetence of Blair&rsquo;s Labour government, and his conversion to the Conservative (Tory) Party general election candidate for Middlesbrough in 2010.</p>
<p>Under his own steam and £15,000 of his own money, John found his opponent, Sir Stuart Bell, the serial incumbent Labour MP, invisible and unknown to his local constituents who nevertheless voted him back in every four or five years (albeit with an ever diminishing majority). Bell was too busy, it seemed, living in Paris, and employing his family not to answer phone calls at his parliamentary office. Worse, his son stole £8,000 worth of stuff from Bell&rsquo;s parliamentary colleagues, eventually serving sixty days in prison for the privilege.</p>
<p>Despite this record of failure, Bell was duly elected again, with Walsh coming in third behind the newly Nick Clegg-revitalised Lib Dems.</p>
<p>Last year, I had my own attempt to counter what I (and many others) saw as corruption, lies, hypocrisy and general incompetence of our local elected councillors. Standing as independent candidates, me and my two friends came fourth in the safest Labour ward in Ealing. It was good fun campaigning, and I enjoyed the physical activity of walking almost every street in my ward dropping leaflets, and the social activity of actually talking to people in person. And we helped to reduce  Labour&rsquo;s vote share and majority (not that it makes any difference to the result).</p>
<p>Still, people voted in their thousands for two councillors who have been in post for twenty four years each, while the problems everyone complains about are the same but worse.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it was another failure to add to my CV.</p>

<hr>
<p>Dear Mr Sharma,</p>
<p>My esteemed representative: I write to you today with a heavy heart, weighed down by the profound disappointment I feel in your recent actions. Your unwavering support for Israel, despite its blatant disregard for international law and its commission of war crimes, has cast a shadow over your impartiality and your ability to hold office effectively.</p>
<p>The recent decision by the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians (ICJP) to serve written notice to Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer of their intention to prosecute UK governmental officials for their role in aiding and abetting Israeli war crimes has sent shockwaves through our nation. Your name, unfortunately, stands out locally among those who have failed to condemn these atrocities, a silence that could have serious criminal ramifications.</p>
<p>I urge you to reconsider your position on this matter. The evidence of Israel&rsquo;s war crimes is overwhelming, documented by the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the International Service for Human Rights. These are not mere accusations; they are indictments of a government that has flagrantly violated international law and caused immense suffering to the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>Your constituents, including myself, have repeatedly implored you to vote for a ceasefire. You claimed to support a ceasefire, but when you had the opportunity to cast your vote to represent your constituents, you failed to do so. Worse, you claimed you did. But &ldquo;humanitarian pauses&rdquo; are not enough; they merely provide Israel with a respite to regroup and continue its assault on innocent civilians. The lack of leadership and condemnation from our elected officials is a stain on our country&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
<p>If you are unwilling to do the right thing and support a ceasefire, then I implore you to step down from your position. You have lost the trust of your constituents, and your continued presence in office is an insult to the values of peace, justice and humanity that we hold dear.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your concerned constituent,</p>
<p>David Marsden</p>

			 <p><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/11/15/curriculum-vitae.html">Following on</a> from my success delivering the news to my local community, I took a break from the world of (very part-time) work to focus on&hellip; playing in my first bands. And learning to play the guitar. Much of which came at the expense of any interest in or motivation to study, or revise for &lsquo;O&rsquo; Levels, and later &lsquo;A&rsquo; Levels.</p>
<p>Living in a small rural market town, some of my friends, and my own younger brother, in fact, had Saturday jobs <em>bush beating</em> - literally (as far as I know) beating bushes to encourage game birds to fly to their sporting deaths. Let&rsquo;s never forget that killing is a sport for our aristocracy and their hangers-on.
Famously, at the time, the host of these shootings was &ldquo;peppered in the buttocks&rdquo; by our drunken home secretary Willie Whitelaw. You couldn&rsquo;t get away with a name like that now.</p>
<p>My brother graduated from bush beating for toffs to hunt sabotage.</p>
<p>I did well enough in my &lsquo;O&rsquo; Levels (one A, eight Bs, and a C), that my maths teacher told me I would &ldquo;never amount to anything&rdquo;. He wasn&rsquo;t wrong.</p>
<p>My dad tried to motivate me after my mock &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level results by leaving me a drunken handwritten note and caricature drawing of me with an arrow pointing to it (I mean, in those days what else could he have done?) saying: &ldquo;THICK CUNT&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Then he got me what felt like a punishing summer job at the duck processing plant where he was a line supervisor. Being the boss&rsquo;s son was no fun when they put me on the killing floor. I became a vegetarian for nine years after that (although since returned to meat eating - that&rsquo;s another story).</p>
<p>I messed up my &lsquo;A&rsquo; Levels (three Es, and failed General Studies writing about the punk band Stiff Little Fingers). I was profoundly depressed, but had no one to talk to about it. Mainly because I had been brought up not to talk about or express any &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; feelings. Random people used to come up to me and say &ldquo;Cheer up, it may never happen&rdquo;, but it in my internal world, it already had.</p>
<p>Music, and playing guitar in a band, was my only outlet, but we were young and totally delusional. We were a three-piece, but believed we were the next <em>Fab Four</em>. We played a successful debut gig in Cleethorpes at <em>The Sub</em>, but instead of building on that, we immediately packed our bags and gear into a van, and drove to London to live in a series of squats in Stepney, Poplar and Limehouse.</p>
<p>An older ex-school friend was part of an anarchist community based out of a bookshop, and helped us find, gain entry to, and occasionally get the water, gas and/or electricity working. In those good old days, you could easily &ldquo;sign on&rdquo; the dole and get enough to actually live on.</p>
<p>I read and heard a lot about the politics of anarchism, which I found very attractive to my idealism. That said, I couldn&rsquo;t ever see how it would work in practice, in the real world. It would need a revolution, of course, but even then, it would need a revolution in people&rsquo;s minds and thinking first.</p>
<p>Six months living in squats, a couple of lousy gigs and a <em><a href="https://www.bandlab.com/davidmarsden/albums/68a3f538-e9bf-ef11-88cf-000d3a930b95">demo tape</a></em> later, we packed our bags and returned home.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had a long and winding career in the fields of work and education. At one time, I was doing quite well, but it all got a bit too much and it&rsquo;s been a bit of a struggle since.</p>
<p>Which is a shame, because it would have been nice if things had turned out better.</p>
<p>I was never really suited to work. It&rsquo;s almost always felt like a real imposition, a drag, and a massive downer.</p>
<p>The money was never enough, and most of it went on social and recreational activities, which, looking back, were a means of self-medication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because I really did try hard to fit in and make a fist of it from the age of twenty-nine to forty-three. A mid-life crisis along with pleurisy, a collapsed lung and an empyema, followed by a thoracotomy, two consecutive nine month long frozen shoulders and that bastard GORD (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease) almost finished me off.</p>
<p>Those fourteen years working in therapeutic activities for older people with dementia, and later in training and employment for with adults with psychotic diagnoses were mostly relatively happy and relatively mostly successful (repeated ultimate catastrophic failures, aside).</p>
<p>I went from wiping arses to leading a rehabilitation centre for some of the most disadvantaged people in society.</p>
<p>Before all of that I&rsquo;d been completely lost. I never wanted to work, only to play music in a band. My first ever paid work was a paper round, but I regularly mis-delivered whenever there was a change to the round. The best thing about that job was getting to read all the different back page headlines and football stories before anyone else.</p>

			 <p>Following on from the <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/27/any-old-pots.html">pots and pans</a> incident, my wife has decreed that the bamboo plates and bowls I bought as child-safe alternatives to our regular crockery are in fact likely coated with melamine and, therefore, toxic.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s probably right, although only for hot food. I had noticed that my hot food tasted a bit funny using these, but I think they&rsquo;re fine for sandwiches and such.</p>

			 <p>Our contract with Plusnet for telephone landline and (not full) fibre broadband ends on 25 November.
I started looking around for cheaper and/or better alternatives back in August. Not that there was anything wrong with Plusnet&rsquo;s service. In fact, compared to Sky and TalkTalk, they&rsquo;re bloody brilliant. But end of contract time usually means either a hike in price to stay loyal, or finding a new provider that offers new customers a better deal than its existing customers.</p>
<p>So, I was very pleasantly surprised to discover a <em>full</em> fibre broadband option available in my area. Apparently, a company called <em>Hey! Broadband</em> had laid there own network of fibre-optic cables in my street, meaning that we could replace our maximum 67Mb download speeds for £28 (due to go up to £54) a month with 900Mb download and upload for 99p a month for the fist six months, and then £29 a month thereafter. It sounded too good to be true!</p>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t need ten times faster broadband, but the extra bandwidth and improved coverage would be nice. It&rsquo;s not uncommon now to have one of us in a Teams meeting, another gaming on his Switch, another watching internet TV, and another doing general internet stuff. The first three, certainly, have all complained at times of lag and buffering. And even the last one has found online work meetings in my bedroom-cum-office occasionally impossible due to poor connectivity.</p>
<p>Hey! Broadband make it clear on their website that they cannot guarantee to be able to connect new customers to their network even if your address is within their network area. There may be unforeseen problems. They also make it clear that potential new customers should <em>not</em> cancel their existing broadband service before you have your new Hey! Broadband service up and running for a couple of weeks without any major issues.</p>
<p>So, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a smooth service. For one, I had no knowledge of when or where the new fibre-optic cables had been laid in our <em>cul-de-sac</em>. On the adjoining road, maybe. But I would let them sort that out. When the two engineers from Hey! Broadband&rsquo;s sub-contracted installation company arrived on 2 October things didn&rsquo;t immediately look hopeful. They were very friendly, but looked barely old enough to be out of school, and had no idea where the cables were outside to connect us up.</p>
<p>After an hour or so of looking around the local area, they came back and informed me of the good news and the bad news. The good news being that they had found a cable that we could, in theory, be connected to. The bad news being that it was on another street around the corner &ldquo;about three doors away&rdquo;. They would need to get permission from the homeowner to go into their premises and then somehow connect the cable up to our non-adjoining property. But I didn&rsquo;t have to worry, they would take care of everything, and we should hear something within five to seven working days.</p>
<p>Of course, seven working days later when I phoned them, nothing at all had been done, and in fact, they asked me to provide contact details for my &ldquo;neighbours&rdquo; and to go knock on their door and ask permission to enter their property. Which I could have done, but as I pointed out, I don&rsquo;t know them, or which house it is, and even if I did, I have no official ID to show that I&rsquo;m an engineer from Hey! Broadband. I asked to speak to a manager, and was told someone would call me back later.</p>
<p>Days passed until another engineer appeared at my door. He was even friendlier than the previous two, and old enough to have a young child of his own. He&rsquo;d already had a look around and found the cable in my next door neighbour&rsquo;s outside storage cupboard (as well as my little kid&rsquo;s trike in our storage cupboard, which he wondered if I still wanted, and if not, could he take it for his little kid?). I let him take the trike, and he promised someone would call later that day to book a new installation date.</p>
<p>No one called, although we still had the revised installation date for 31 October, and another even friendlier and slightly older engineer showed up. He actually managed to connect us up, pulling the cable through from the street next to our <em>cul-de-sac</em> (&ldquo;the longest pull&rdquo; he&rsquo;d ever done), cabling it out from our neighbour&rsquo;s storage cupboard up and over our communal porch and up our wall to our first floor flat. He drilled a hole in our wall (reassuring my wife that, no, the hole wouldn&rsquo;t let cold air or creepy crawlies in) and set us up with new full fibre broadband.</p>
<p>It turned out that he&rsquo;s self-employed, and does up to five of these installations a day at a £100 a go. He left school aged eleven unable to read or write. As he wired up our new modem, he told me how he had a habit, when younger, of setting fire to things. He went back to college to learn to read and write when his kids started coming home from school asking for help with school work, and he didn&rsquo;t want to tell them he couldn&rsquo;t do it. He didn&rsquo;t ask for a trike, either.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I met him again two days later around the corner from my big kid&rsquo;s school while we were feeding the <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/12/community-cats.html">community cats</a>. He was doing an installation there, or trying to. Unfortunately, he wasn&rsquo;t able to pull the cable through on this  occasion.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had Hey! Broadband for a week without any issues at all, and full 900Mb ethernet speeds as advertised, with wifi speeds around 150Mb down and 250Mb up.  No telephone landline anymore, which is no loss, as we only ever used it to answer scam calls. I&rsquo;m now a [Hey!

<p>But we all had fun, and the kids got to spend time with their grandparents who live nearby. And use their wifi.</p>

<p>Frank was my great grandfather on my dad&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>I only met him a couple of times. One time, me and my brother were made to wear the most ridiculous and embarrassing outfits, and we just felt very uncomfortable and ill-at-ease meeting this very old man from another time.</p>
<p>He was born in the early 1901. So he must have been 80 or so when we met him. Not so old these days, but back then he really was like a dinosaur, or a fossil.</p>
<p>I remember a couple of stories about him. After the Great War, when he was a young man with a new wife and baby daughter (my grandmother), he had to walk twenty-five miles to work, where he would labour hard for sixteen hours before walking home again, only to be brutally murdered by his father before going to bed and getting up the next morning to do the same thing over and over again. Well, he certainly had to work hard, just to survive and raise a family.</p>
<p>Life was no doubt much harder then than any of us can really imagine, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKHFZBUTA4k">you try and tell that to the young people of today. Would they believe you? No!</a></p>
<p>My great grandmother, Ellen, was committed to Lancaster Asylum some time after my grandmother Freda was born. I don&rsquo;t know what the reason was, but it&rsquo;s possible it was because she was suffering from what would now be recognised as post-natal depression.</p>
<p>In those days, it was a life sentence, not to mention the shame it brought upon the family.</p>
<p>Frank divorced Ellen and married &ldquo;Auntie Florrie&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know if Florrie was actually Ellen&rsquo;s sister, but it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Freda never forgot her mum, and secretly visited her whenever she could.</p>
<p>When Frank got the cancer that would kill him, Freda took him in and looked after him in her bed until he died.</p>

			 <p>My three and a half year old is going through that stage where he doesn&rsquo;t want to get dressed in the morning to go to nursery.</p>
<p>I remember with my oldest lad some mornings I used to be in tears trying to get him ready.</p>
<p>Fortunately, their mum is now working from home and has taken on this task with the little one. My main job now is to remind my nine year old to &ldquo;sit at the table and eat your breakfast&rdquo; every two minutes.</p>
<p>Up until a couple of weeks ago, my secondary role was as assistant little kid dresser. I would sit him on my knee with one arm around his chest holding his arms down, while trying to hold a leg or a foot so that his mum could forcibly put on his underpants, socks and trousers without him kicking or pulling them off again.</p>
<p>Mum has now found a much more kid-friendly method, with no tears.</p>
<p>Underpants are now butterflies, fluttering around looking for somewhere to land. Socks, of course, make great foot-puppets. Trousers are caterpillars crawling on a tree branch, and his coat is a big brown bear who just wants a hug.</p>

			 <p>My nine year old had a trim the other day. No one else can really tell, but his massive afro isn&rsquo;t quite so massive as it was last week, and certainly a little less knotted.</p>
<p>Should make it easier to <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/02/noodle.html">get his swimming cap on</a>.</p>
<p>His mum cuts his hair. We took him to a barber&rsquo;s when he was younger, and I literally had to hold him down while the barber did his work.</p>
<p>I never liked having my hair cut. I used to have very thick curly hair as a boy, although not an afro. My mum used to use what she called <em>thinning scissors</em>, which were kind of like scissors with teeth. It felt like having my hair pulled out.</p>
<p>I think as kids we&rsquo;re just so much more sensitive to all these things. And my lad&rsquo;s hair is a core part of his identity. (When he was younger, he used to identify as a lion, so his hair was his mane.)</p>
<p>I managed to overcome my fear of hair cutting as an adult, and even found a reliable barber pre-covid. Since the pandemic, like many others, I bought a pair of clippers and do it myself now.</p>

			 <p>Last week, we had a visitor.</p>
<p>Catwoman appeared, to save the day!</p>
<p>All the way from leafy Surrey, she turned up in her Porsche 4x4 and catsuit to catch our <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/12/community-cats.html">community cats</a> and take them to the vet &ldquo;because they have cat flu&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With her ten year old assistant, and cat trap, she tried for (what seemed like) hours to catch a cat, or a kitten, to no avail.</p>

			 <p>Inevitably, as I sit here in the cafe next to my son&rsquo;s swimming lesson, <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/09/29/human-shield.html">unable to drink coffee because the cafe</a> is permanently closed, my mind wanders and starts thinking about coffee.</p>
<p>For most of my adult life, I&rsquo;ve started the day with a cup of tea. Regular English breakfast tea. PG Tips, Tetley. Milk and sugar.</p>
<p>Tea was always my preferred drink, but I did like a cup of instant coffee or two later in the morning, but only if it was one I liked. I wasn&rsquo;t fond of Nescafe or the other regular blends.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I switched to Rooibos (redbush) tea, and never went back. I also started appreciating real coffee made in a French press, and later got my own Aeropress. What really sealed the coffee deal, was discovering fresh coffee beans that aren&rsquo;t burnt (Pact Coffee).</p>
<p>About three years ago, I backed a Kickstarter campaign to build an affordable, portable espresso maker, <em>CoffeeJack</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not one of those people who backs a lot of these types of things, although it wasn&rsquo;t my first or last. I understand that it&rsquo;s not like ordering from Amazon or anywhere else. You&rsquo;re backing a project with money in the hope that it&rsquo;s successful and that you end up with a product that works as described. There&rsquo;s no guarantee.</p>
<p>Now, <em>CoffeeJack</em> delivered about three years after they got my money. Which is a long time! They had lots of problems along the way, including, of course, the covid pandemic. So fair play to them for getting their project finished at all. And it was worth the wait, in my opinion. They produced exactly what they promised, and for six months I had two cups a day of the best coffee I&rsquo;ve ever tasted.</p>
<p>Sadly, just when I thought I&rsquo;d cracked it, I cracked the bayonet on my <em>CoffeeJack</em>. Too much pressure, to quote The Selector.</p>

			 <p>Last week, my boss asked me to produce a professional looking ten page job profile for a potential new appointment.</p>
<p>He provided me with an example from another employer, and asked me to use the same format.</p>
<p>He wanted me to find some suitable photographs &ldquo;online&rdquo; to use.</p>
<p>This was all outside of his skillset.</p>
<p>And mine.</p>
<p>He wanted it &ldquo;by tomorrow&rdquo; (Wednesday), and gave me the text he&rsquo;d written for the first page, as well as the headings he wanted to use for the remaining pages.</p>
<p>The formatted example he&rsquo;d given me was a pdf. I was very pleased to discover that Adobe now provides a free pdf to Word conversion, which certainly made my job easier.</p>
<p>It was easy enough to find photographs, of course, but not so much photographs that are free to use. My boss later told me he wasn&rsquo;t worried about that, as he &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t using them for commercial purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day (Wednesday), my boss emailed to say he would send me the final nine pages of text he still hadn&rsquo;t written &ldquo;tomorrow morning&rdquo; (Thursday), and that &ldquo;we&rdquo; would &ldquo;populate&rdquo; the template document then.</p>
<p>While I was eating lunch the next day (Thursday), his email arrived leaving me two hours to put the whole thing together. I didn&rsquo;t think it would be enough time, but just got on with it.</p>
<p>Two hours later, I still had two pages to do, but had to collect my kids from nursery and school, make their tea (or dinner, as they call it), and get them in the bath. I managed to finish it later while they watched TV.</p>
<p>My boss was very pleased, although he said he didn&rsquo;t expect anyone would actually see it.</p>

			 <p>Just around the corner from my lad&rsquo;s school by the canal is a <em>cul-de-sac</em> which is home to some &ldquo;community cats&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Having spoken to a few of the people who live there, it seems that none of the seven or eight cats and kittens have homes or owners, but are looked after by the people who live there.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not strays, but they&rsquo;re not feral, either. They&rsquo;re community cats.</p>
<p>These cats have been around for as long as I can remember (which admittedly isn&rsquo;t so long these days), but it&rsquo;s only in the last few weeks that they have become of growing interest to my lad and some of his friends on their way to and from school.</p>
<p>What started off as simply &ldquo;aw, look there&rsquo;s a cat&rdquo;, has now become a financial investment in daily supplies of cat food, and extra time in the morning and afternoon to stop, feed and stroke Tab, Abby, Popcorn, Tiny, Smoky, Toffee and one or two others I can&rsquo;t remember the names of.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of sharing a few photos of these cats with my cat obsessed mother, who was very upset that they don&rsquo;t have warm, dry homes and owners who overfeed them with specially bought and cooked fish. I&rsquo;ve tried to reassure her that they look healthy (shiny coats), well-fed and looked after.</p>

			 <p>There seems to be a co-ordinated drive to obliterate Palestine, and Palestinians, from the map.</p>
<p>I find it very upsetting that my government, and many other &ldquo;Western&rdquo; governments are wholeheartedly supporting Israel&rsquo;s genocidal &ldquo;self-defence&rdquo; narrative.</p>
<p>Nothing justifies carpet-bombing innocent people - mostly women and children.</p>
<p>Nothing justifies cutting off their supplies of electricity, water, food, fuel.</p>
<p>The sadistic Netanyahu told Palestinians in Gaza to leave, then bombed the crossing into Egypt while they tried to do so.</p>
<p>These are war crimes.</p>
<p>Now, our fascist government is attempting to outlaw any expression of support for the people of Gaza and Palestine.</p>
<p>Fully supported and enabled by our fascist &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; party.</p>
<p>The Labour Mayor of London helped to spread what turned out to be fake news about an alleged anti-Semitic attack on a Jewish-owned shop. Known liar Luciana Berger, MP, did the same. As did countless other &ldquo;sensible, adult centrists&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not anti-Semitic to support the people of Palestine in their long struggle for freedom from Israel&rsquo;s oppression.</p>

			 <p>We used to play in the street outside our home as kids growing up in the 70s. In rural Lincolnshire. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t a main road, it was the road on our council estate. Pretty much everyone had a car, and many of the houses had their own garage.</p>
<p>In London, or Greater London, it&rsquo;s generally not safe for kids to play in the street, although we&rsquo;re lucky where we are that our little <em>cul-de-sac</em> can double-up as a relatively safe enough play area most of the time.</p>
<p>The road next to us is an HGV Access Road, thanks to our local ward councillor and current council leader.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely NOT safe for kids to play in at all.</p>
<p>Not until the Water Company came along. For the past two or three weeks, they have closed part of the road where my sons&rsquo; friends live to clear the pipes of wet wipes, sanitary products, fat and oil.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve dug a massive hole in the road, which I&rsquo;ve told my nine year old is <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/06/class.html"><em>The Pit of Tartarus</em></a>. It&rsquo;s all barricaded off, with heavy machinery, waste skips and various bits of equipment.</p>
<p>So the road is now a no through road, with access only for residents and deliveries.</p>
<p>My kids and their friends have really enjoyed playing out in the street whenever they can, thanks also to our &ldquo;Indian Summer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of drivers who ignore (or don&rsquo;t see?) the signs telling them the road is closed, and drive down it anyway. My job was mostly to tell them, &ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t drive on the pavement. Can&rsquo;t you see there are kids playing? Plus, it&rsquo;s a pavement. This isn&rsquo;t the Wild West!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, everyone was reasonable enough when challenged to back away, turnaround and drive around following the &ldquo;diverted traffic&rdquo; signs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my job was made redundant by the older kids in the group, who took it upon themselves to relieve me of my onerous duties. They barricaded the pavements with spare cones, and now they marshall the traffic. Much more effective!</p>

			 <p><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/04/distraction.html">Thinking about Maths at school</a>, got me thinking about the origin and meaning of <em>class</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a classic word, and means so many different things depending on the context in which it&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>Its Roman <a href="https://latin-dictionary.net/definition/10289/classis-classis">origin</a> relates to the dividing up of society, or groups of people for war or military objectives.</p>
<p>My Latin teacher at school was obsessed with lining up the desks and chairs at the end of each lesson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caecilius pater est&rdquo; is the only Latin I can remember.</p>
<p>We rebelled, and persuaded our headteacher to teach us <em>Classics in Translation</em> instead. That was fun. Reading, and learning all about ancient Greek philosophy and mythology.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s easy to get distracted.</p>
<p>My nine year old told his mum last night that he was so distracted by thoughts in his head at school that the teacher gave him a blank piece of paper and a pen to &ldquo;download&rdquo; everything in his mind.</p>
<p>All he could think about was <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>Nintendo</em>.</p>
<p>Well, it <em>was</em> Maths.</p>
<p>I always liked Maths at school. Mainly because there was no homework, or writing, or revision to do. Either I knew it or I didn&rsquo;t. And I mostly did, up until A Levels.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;Pure Maths&rdquo; teacher told me I would never amount to anything. I guess he was right about that.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;Applied Maths&rdquo; teacher tried to make lessons more memorable by telling us a story about a man who grew jellies in his garden. I guess <em>he</em> was right about <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>I got a B grade in O Level Maths. If I&rsquo;d actually made any kind of effort I could probably have got an A. Things could have been oh so different!</p>

			 <p>My nine year old is on week three of his school swimming lessons.</p>
<p>Prior to the first lesson, he was very anxious about getting his hair wet, and getting his nose under the water. This, despite the fact that he absolutely <em>loved</em> the sea and the pool on our holiday last month (and last year, and the year before that).</p>
<p>We bought him a swimming cap, which everyone has to wear in any case. He&rsquo;s got massive natural afro hair, so the first three swimming caps we bought were too small.</p>
<p>He was very anxious about putting on his swimming cap for the lessons. I said I would help him, as <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/09/29/human-shield.html">I would be there</a>, but of course, that never happened as they all just marched straight into the changing rooms leaving me alone with my coffee-free café.</p>
<p>Fortunately, one of the teaching staff helps him with his cap.</p>
<p>So he keeps his hair dry. And after the second lesson last week, he came home and informed us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>he put his nose under the water and survived</li>
<li>he wants to go swimming at the weekend</li>
<li>he wants a swimming &ldquo;noodle&rdquo;.</li>

			 <p>The school asked for a parent to volunteer to accompany the children to their weekly swimming class.</p>
<p>They said I could sit in the café and drink coffee. No swimming required. I volunteered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically a fourth chaperone, in addition to the three teaching staff. I simply accompany the children to their swimming class, and back.</p>
<p>The class teacher gave me the two page risk assessment to read on the first morning, and I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself to stand either at the back of the line of kids, or in the middle, depending on where there is a gap of supervising adults. I try to act as a human shield on zebra crossings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>While the kids are having their swimming lesson, I sit in the adjacent café (which is permanently closed, by the way) with my distraction-free writing device. I get an hour a week now to write in peace. It&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2023/09/20/the-door.html">Last week, we had a new front door fitted</a>.</p>
<p>That morning, I took it upon myself to prepare a bolognese before the doormen arrived so that we didn&rsquo;t need to get in each other&rsquo;s way, and so that we had something to eat for lunch for the next few days.</p>
<p>I make my bolognese in a 12&quot; frying pan and cover it with a grease splatter fine mesh to let it cook slowly for a few hours. When the doormen arrived, that&rsquo;s exactly what my bolognese was doing.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t realise, until it was too late, is that the dust from their drilling and general doormen work was settling on the stove top in front of my bolognese on the back of the stove.</p>
<p>This was brought to my attention by my wife, who was already in a state of being <em>very upset</em> by the new door hanging to the right and not the left like her old door.</p>
<p>I inspected the bolognese and the splatter mesh cover carefully for signs of white paint dust similar the to very evident white paint dust sitting on top of the stove.</p>
<p>I honestly couldn&rsquo;t see anything, although the bolognese did have quite a sheen (although this was after I&rsquo;d just added some milk to it).</p>
<p>Anyway, my wife refused to eat it, so I had no choice, really, but to eat all of it over the next four days.</p>
<p>If anything, it tasted a bit spicier than normal, not in a bad way, and I have not grown any extra fingers, yet.</p>

			 <p>The door was old, but it still functioned as a door. It opened and closed, and kept us safe and warm.</p>
<p>As it got older, it got a bit cranky and quirky.</p>
<p>The spring-loaded closing mechanism no longer worked as it should. If you were a small person, a cat or a delivery driver, you had to beware this big old heavy door slamming shut whether you were in, out, or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Sometimes the lock wouldn&rsquo;t work at all and you had to hope there was someone inside who would let you in. Mostly, it required a certain knack to unlock it. Which kept kids out, and ensured extra exercise for grown-ups getting up off the sofa to let kids in.</p>
<p>One day, the housing association&rsquo;s sub-contractors came to take our door away. It was a fire safety hazard, according to a very expensive risk assessment they carried out several years ago in the wake of the Grenfell Fire.</p>
<p>They came, they saw(ed), they removed our old door in five minutes flat, leaving a gaping hole.</p>
<p>The new door is sleek and fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a like for like replacement,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip; the handle is on the right hand side,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the door opens to the left not the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very unhappy,&rdquo; said my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not magnetic,&rdquo; said my nine year old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s they keyhole?&rdquo; my three year old didn&rsquo;t say, but the question must surely have been going through his mind as he tried to unlock the door on the wrong (right) side with the new key.</p>

			 <p>I got a <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/19099/to_cash_2_august_2023_from_cllr_peter_mason.pdf">reply to my open letter to Peter Mason</a>[pdf], Leader of Ealing Council, and one of my local ward councillors.</p>
<p>Slightly oddly, he addressed it not just to me, but also to CASH (<a href="https://southallandhayescleanair.org.uk/">Clean Air for Southall and Hayes</a>, and my neighbour Angela Fonso (who heads up the campaign group. You can see a record of all Mason&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/6227/southall_gasworks_correspondence"><em>Letters to CASH</em></a>, if you&rsquo;re interested in the history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also submitted two <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/user/david_marsden_2/requests">Freedom of Information requests</a>(FOIs) to try to get answers, as I didn&rsquo;t expect a reply (as he has never replied directly to any of my previous questions).</p>
<p>The FOI response on the developer Berkeley Group&rsquo;s sponsorship of council events <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/1000452/response/2374307/attach/html/5/FOI%20Response%2023%200820%20FINAL.pdf.html">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mayor of Ealing had sought sponsors for his Pride reception. Berkeley responded to this request
and offered a £500 contribution to the event. However, while the offer was publicly acknowledged, the
money was never accepted or received because the Council is committed to not accept sponsorship
from Berkeley for corporate events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The FOI response on the council&rsquo;s relationship with developers was, to my mind, wholly unsatisfactory and generated <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/ealing_councils_relationships_wi#outgoing-1498781">a third FOI</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, plain English perhaps, it took two years to put in place any formal procedure to uphold the Leader&rsquo;s stated aims, and there is literally nothing to see to evidence that councillors are following the procedure, or will do. And the fact that there is nothing to see to evidence your claims is, you claim, an indication of the council&rsquo;s commitment to transparency?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s my reply to his reply (via his Head of Cabinet Office).</p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks for passing on Cllr Mason&rsquo;s response. Please pass this on to him.</p>
<p>I appreciate Cllr Mason&rsquo;s honesty in acknowledging that the Mayor accepted Berkeley Group&rsquo;s offer of sponsorship, contrary to council policy.</p>
<p>I also appreciate that the Mayor, councillors and officers have been reminded of the policy going forward.</p>
<p>However, the Mayor&rsquo;s original tweet still stands, published, thanking Berkeley Group for sponsoring the event.</p>
<p>I would like to know why this tweet has not been retracted or clarified, because it continues to give what I am now asked to believe by Cllr Mason is a wholly misleading statement of Ealing Council policy, as well as free good marketing publicity for what is a proscribed organisation. That&rsquo;s even worse than accepting sponsorship. (I hope that Berkeley Group were asked to donate their sponsorship directly to one of the Mayor&rsquo;s charities instead.)</p>
<p>I would like Cllr Mason, the council leader, to ensure that the Mayor removes and publicly clarifies and apologises for his tweet, and mistakenly accepting Berkeley&rsquo;s offer. I would like him to explain why it was a mistake and why it&rsquo;s necessary to apologise.</p>
<p>In Southall, we&rsquo;ve suffered, as Cllr Mason recently acknowledged in <a href="https://youtu.be/M_vj2l2_JuY">one of his self-promotion videos</a>, six years of &ldquo;many, many terrible smells and certainly some bad chemicals released into the environment&rdquo;, which have undoubtedly caused long-term mental and physical health problems for residents young and old.</p>
<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t need to remind anyone that Southall is home to by far the largest South Asian and Black community in Ealing, and the lowest average incomes, who are among the most vulnerable to the adverse health impacts of these &ldquo;bad chemicals&rdquo;. In addition, Southall residents live with some of the worst air pollution in Ealing from traffic congestion, FM Conway asphalt plant, and non-permitted incinerators. Some environmental justice campaigners describe this as a &ldquo;sacrifice zone&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s very hurtful, insulting and offensive to people in Southall, who have suffered and sacrificed so much, to see the new Mayor break the council leader&rsquo;s pledge, and offer no public retraction, acknowledgement, clarification or apology. It&rsquo;s as if his words have no consequences. It&rsquo;s as if South Asian and Black lives don&rsquo;t matter, or South Asian and Blacks don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>I would also question how the offer of sponsorship came about. We all know that the person responsible for &ldquo;Community Liaison&rdquo; for Berkeley Group is Jags Sanghera, who was a Labour Party councillor candidate in last year&rsquo;s local elections. Why is Jags, who came close to being elected as a councillor, offering sponsorship to the Mayor? It does make me wonder if councillors (and prospective councillors) have ever been told of the council policy, and when? Not to mention the obvious conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Will Cllr Mason establish a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy for accepting sponsorship, gifts and hospitality going forward (and, perhaps, apply it retrospectively)?</p>
<p>With regard to Cllr Jassal&rsquo;s participation in Berkeley Group&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Engagement&rdquo; steering group, I&rsquo;d have more confidence in Cllr Mason&rsquo;s assertion that this is to hold them to account if the group wasn&rsquo;t set up and controlled by Berkeley Group and Jags Sanghera. Were CASH invited to be members? Was I? No. Why not? Because as far as I can see, we are among the only people who do consistently try to hold Berkeley Group to account, and their relationship with the council.</p>
<p>As Cllr Mason addressed his reply to me to Angela and CASH as well, I&rsquo;ve copied them in to this.</p>
<p>Yours&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Publishing this as it&rsquo;s in the public interest and I&rsquo;ve had no reply to my original email sent on 1st July (Mason has, as far as I know, several personal assistants who read and respond to his emails, even if it&rsquo;s just a holding acknowledgement response - I&rsquo;ve had one before, as well as a next day reply, and a &rsquo;no reply at all&rsquo;).</p>

<hr>
<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>In your <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/16565/to_cash_12_july_2021.pdf">open letter</a> to Angela Fonso and CASH dated 12 July 2021, you pledged that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;[t]he Council will not take any further sponsorship from Berkeley Group.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was shocked, therefore, to see the new Mayor of Ealing <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorofEaling/status/1674705592974286850">tweet</a> to thank Berkeley Group for their sponsorship of an event he organised and hosted.</p>
<p>In your letter mentioned above, you also stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am determined to ensure that the Council’s future dealings with developers are transparent, arms-length and do not give rise to concerns that it is privileging the relationship with developers above that with residents.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was dismayed, therefore, to discover (from Berkeley marketing material, hand delivered, photo attached) that a Southall councillor (Cllr Jassal) and a council officer (Evelyn Gloyn, Ealing&rsquo;s Community Engagement Manager) are members of Berkeley Group&rsquo;s new &ldquo;community engagement&rdquo; steering group. This clear conflict of interest with the health and wellbeing of residents who Cllr Jassal is elected to represent does not appear on <a href="https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/mgListDeclarationsOfInterest.aspx?UID=365">Cllr Jassal&rsquo;s declaration of interests on the council website</a>. Cllr Jassal and Evelyn Gloyn are literally standing shoulder to shoulder with Berkeley Group, not at &ldquo;arms-length&rdquo;, as you pledged two years ago.</p>
<p>I note also that various councillors have continued to attend Berkeley Group&rsquo;s marketing events (sold as &ldquo;community events&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I know you have a very strong commitment to leading an open and transparent administration, and so, therefore, I ask you to tell me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the monetary value of &ldquo;sponsorship&rdquo; Ealing Council (councillors, officers, Mayor) has accepted from Berkeley Group since your letter of 12 July 2021, and for which events?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Ealing Council policy for councillors, officers, Mayor, for accepting sponsorship, hospitality and gifts from developers, and to ensure that the Council will not take any further sponsorship from Berkeley Group?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the action you will take to prevent councillors, officers, Mayor accepting sponsorship, hospitality and gifts from developers in future, and publicly returning sponsorship already received from Berkeley Group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Ealing Council policy for councillors, officers, Mayor, to ensure future dealings with developers are transparent, arms-length and do not give rise to concerns that it is privileging the relationship with developers above that with residents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the action you will take to prevent councillors, officers, Mayor privileging the relationship with developers above that with residents, and publicly disengaging from Berkeley Group&rsquo;s profit-driven marketing schemes dressed up as &ldquo;community engagement&rdquo;?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>David Marsden</p>

<p>The health risks from remediating Southall Gasworks on site in the open air are significant. The site is highly contaminated with a variety of hazardous chemicals, including benzene, naphthalene, VOCs, PAHs, heavy metals, &ldquo;blue billy&rdquo; and asbestos. These chemicals can cause a variety of health problems, including cancer, respiratory problems, neurological problems, and birth defects. The local community is mostly of south Asian and African heritage, and it is known that people with this heritage can be genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. This means that they are more likely to experience health problems from exposure to naphthalene.</p>
<p>If levels of benzene and naphthalene are consistently above the legal safety guidelines, and local residents complain of eye, nose and throat irritation, new or worsening of respiratory conditions and infections, or other health problems as a result of odour and air pollution, the developer and regulatory authorities should take immediate action to protect the health of the community. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stopping the remediation work until the levels of contamination can be brought down to safe levels.</li>
<li>Providing air filters and other protective equipment to residents who live near the site.</li>
<li>Evacuation of residents who are most at risk.</li>
<li>Conducting a health study of the community to assess the impact of the contamination.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer and regulatory authorities have a responsibility to protect the health of the community. If they fail to take action, they could be held liable for any health problems that result from the contamination.</p>
<p>Here are some additional information about the health risks of the chemicals found at Southall Gasworks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benzene:</strong> Benzene is a colorless, flammable liquid that is used in a variety of products, including gasoline, paints, and solvents. It is a known carcinogen, and it can also cause leukemia, anemia, and other health problems.</li>
<li><strong>Naphthalene:</strong> Naphthalene is a white, crystalline solid that is used in mothballs and other products. It is also a known carcinogen, and it can cause respiratory problems, skin irritation, and other health problems.</li>
<li><strong>VOCs:</strong> Volatile organic compounds are a group of chemicals that can easily evaporate into the air. They can come from a variety of sources, including gasoline, paints, and solvents. VOCs can cause a variety of health problems, including respiratory problems, headaches, nausea, and cancer.</li>
<li><strong>PAHs:</strong> Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed when organic matter is burned. They are found in a variety of sources, including gasoline, coal, and tobacco smoke. PAHs can cause cancer, respiratory problems, and other health problems.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy metals:</strong> Heavy metals are a group of metals that are toxic to humans and other animals. They can come from a variety of sources, including mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. Heavy metals can cause a variety of health problems, including cancer, neurological problems, and birth defects.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Blue billy&rdquo;:</strong> Blue billy is a type of asbestos that is found in coal tar. Asbestos is a known carcinogen, and it can cause a variety of health problems, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that the health risks of exposure to these chemicals vary depending on the level of exposure, the length of exposure, and the individual&rsquo;s health. If you are concerned about your health after being exposed to these chemicals, you should see a doctor.</p>

			 <p>I asked <a href="bard.google.com">Google Bard</a> to advise me on a local matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the leader of Ealing Council. I have received more than 250 reports about a BAD odour nuisance and air pollution from the remediation of the highly contaminated Southall Gasworks land. We had a public meeting where 250 angry residents complained about health problems as a result of the air pollution, including eye, nose and throat irritation, respiratory problems and infections, and even cancer and death of loved ones. The developer has implemented increased odour suppression to the satisfaction of the Environment Agency. I&rsquo;ve given residents three numbers to call, each of which takes twenty minutes or more to get through and treats every report as an isolated incident. By the time my investigating officers arrive hours later the smell has gone. I&rsquo;ve accepted over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from the developer. What should I do?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What you should do:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resign as leader of Ealing Council.</strong> Accepting over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from the developer creates a clear conflict of interest. You are no longer in a position to objectively represent the interests of the residents of Ealing.</li>
<li><strong>Publicly apologize to the residents of Ealing for your actions.</strong> Acknowledge that you have made a mistake and that you are truly sorry for the harm that you have caused.</li>
<li><strong>Refund the developer all of the gifts and hospitality that you have accepted.</strong> This will demonstrate that you are serious about addressing the conflict of interest and that you are committed to acting in the best interests of the residents of Ealing.</li>
<li><strong>Work with the developer to find a solution to the air pollution problem.</strong> This may involve additional odour suppression measures, compensation for residents who have been harmed by the air pollution, or other measures.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure that residents have a way to report air pollution problems quickly and easily.</strong> This could involve setting up a dedicated hotline or website, or making it easier for residents to contact the council.</li>
<li><strong>Investigate all reports of air pollution promptly and thoroughly.</strong> This will help to ensure that residents are taken seriously and that their concerns are addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the public informed about the progress of your efforts to address the air pollution problem.</strong> This will help to build trust and confidence between the council and the residents of Ealing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What you should not do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not deny or downplay the seriousness of the air pollution problem.</strong> The residents of Ealing are suffering, and they deserve to be taken seriously.</li>
<li><strong>Do not try to cover up your conflict of interest.</strong> The public has a right to know about any potential conflicts of interest that could affect the way you make decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Do not try to blame the developer or anyone else for the air pollution problem.</strong> As the leader of Ealing Council, you are ultimately responsible for the health and safety of the residents of your borough.</li>
<li><strong>Do not give up on finding a solution to the air pollution problem.</strong> The residents of Ealing deserve to live in a clean and healthy environment, and you have a responsibility to do everything you can to make that happen.</li>

<p>It&rsquo;s the sad and shocking story of children in Iraq dying from leukaemia as a result of toxic air pollution from mega rich oil companies burning off excess natural gas in the open air near their homes.</p>
<p>Benzene (found in the air) and naphthalene (found in the children&rsquo;s urine samples) are the main carcinogens.</p>
<p>Levels of benzene are between 3 and 9.6 Micrograms per cubic meter or &ldquo;µg/m3&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Levels of benzene by the so-called soil &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; at Southall Gasworks were between 4 and 12 Micrograms per cubic meter or &ldquo;µg/m3&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Two years ago my then six year old took what turned out to be a permanent break from the daily fifteen minute <a href="https://www.easyreadsystem.com/index.php">Easyread</a> lessons he&rsquo;d been doing for six months to catch up on his reading. When he started, he couldn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t read.</p>
<p>At the weekend he asked to go to the library where he chose a book by his favourite author. The following two mornings he read a chapter to himself before breakfast instead of watching TV.</p>
<p>Tonight he read a few pages out loud to me at bedtime, just to show off.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BwkdGr9JYmE">In the words of Bill Hicks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve noticed a certain anti-intellectualism going around this country, man …</p>
<p>I was in Nashville, Tennessee last week and after the show I went to a Waffle House, right, and I’m sitting there and I’m eating and I’m reading a book. I don’t know anyone, I’m alone.</p>
<p>I’m eating, and I’m reading a book. And this waitress walks over to me: “(tut tut tut) What you readin’ for?”</p>
<p>Wow, I’ve never been asked that! Not what am I reading, but what am I reading FOR?</p>
<p>Well, goddamnit, ya stumped me!</p>
<p>Why do I read?</p>
<p>I guess I read for a lot of reasons and the main one is so I don’t end up being a fucking waffle waitress …</p>
<p>Then this trucker in the next booth gets up, stands over me and goes, “Well, looks like we’ve got ourselves a reader…</p>

			 <p>I visited the Palace of Westminster this week with my big kid on an educational school trip.</p>
<p>It was a very cold, wet and windy day, and we were patriotically under-dressed and sans brollies. We took a good lashing from Mother Nature.</p>
<p>The tour of the Houses of Parliament was cool, dry and stuffy, and the little radio headphones we were given so we could hear better were sub-optimal.</p>
<p>The House of Commons was closed to ordinary commoners like us, but the House of Lords was open as long as we refrained from parking our cold, wet and windy working class bums on our superiors&rsquo; &lsquo;holier than thou&rsquo; red leather benches. Police guards armed with sub-machine guns would forcibly remove any insubordinate eight or nine year olds, and presumably march them straight to the Tower of London (or shoot them dead if they looked like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/17/de-menezes-family-call-cressida-dick-barred-from-leading-met">Jean Charles de Menezes</a>.</p>
<p>The children asked a police officer why he carried a gun, and they learned it is to keep them safe. That may be true, but I didn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> safer, and there were no <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/01/police-must-win-back-public-confidence-after-sarah-everard-case-says-minister">buses to flag down</a>.</p>
<p>The children learned that murderous megalomaniac misogynist King Henry VIII is still held in very high regard in these parts, despite beheading two of his six wives, and creating a new religion and laws to divorce two more.</p>
<p>I asked the children how the chamber of the House of Lords made them feel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had lunch across the road outside Portcullis House where we could shelter a little from the wind and rain. Portcullis House is where elected Members of Parliament (MP) and their staff have offices. There were lots of posh-looking mostly white men going in and out and getting frisked inside by more armed guards. Out in the cold, we shared our lunch with toothless and homeless Len, who we found sleeping in the doorway next to us, and looking very wet and cold. Len told us he was &ldquo;a midget, a dwarf from Burnley&rdquo; and he&rsquo;d come to London to sort his life out, but his marriage failed and here he was. He was very pleased to have a homemade tuna mayonnaise sandwich, a juice drink and a satsuma. My wife told me off when we got home, claiming that he will have sold or exchanged the sandwich for drugs.</p>
<p>We waited for our own MP <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2022/02/11/trigger-vote-for.html">Virendra Sharma</a> to come and meet us as the teachers had arranged. No one knew what he looked like, so they asked me as my lad told them I had met him before (which is true). Then we played a game &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sharma?&rdquo; until he appeared. Mr Sharma thanked the kids for coming to meet him, and asked them who wanted his job. His two assistants took photographs.</p>
<p>We ended the day by getting drenched walking up to see Downing Street and the Horse Guards Parade. Downing Street was, of course, guarded by more armed police and totally inaccessible to us ordinary folk, and the parade smelled of horse shit.</p>

			 <p>Ealing Council&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7039/ealing_council_air_quality_strategy_2020-30">draft Air Quality Strategy</a> is a 64 page document together with a 40 page <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7038/ealing_draft_air_quality_action_plan_2022-2027">Action Plan</a>, and the consultation period runs until 30 January 2023. It&rsquo;s taken me the best part of six weeks, all my spare time over Christmas and New Year, to get through it all, make notes and cross-reference to try to make sense of it all and offer some feedback.</p>
<p>Really, there must be a much longer consultation period if Ealing Council is genuinely interested in residents&rsquo; views.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of what the key points of interest are for me, and in particular in relation to Southall, where I live and work. My additional suggestions are <strong>in bold</strong>, and my comments and questions in <em>italics</em>.</p>
<h4 id="warning">Warning</h4>
<p>This is a LONG post. I&rsquo;ve tried to break it into sections to make it easier to read.</p>
<h4 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h4>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t claim to be an expert, other than through experience. I am just an ordinary resident living in the midst of four major industrial and construction site polluters for several years. I have campaigned alongside my family, neighbours and friends for clean air after my then nearly four year old said he wanted fresh air not stinky air. He&rsquo;d been hospitalised three times when he was two and diagnosed with asthma. We soon discovered people who had lost loved ones, had heart attacks, ectopic pregnancies, cancer, all attributed to the foul petrochemical stink.</em></p>
<p><em>I welcome any corrections.</em></p>
<h1 id="my-summary">My Summary</h1>
<p><strong>If Ealing is serious about &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; inequalities, action must be targeted to protect vulnerable people in Southall to reduce air pollution and its impact on the health of its large, mostly economically deprived and non-white population.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Strategy and Plan must target children and older people, people with lung conditions, and pregnant women: outside schools and school run hours. The Council must question if it is ethical to promote active travel in Southall when it knows that it is a high pollution area and that most of its population is particularly vulnerable to its adverse health impacts.</strong></p>
<p>The draft strategy and action plan don&rsquo;t do this at all.</p>

<p><em>To begin, I think it’s fantastic that Ealing Council has stated its vision for clean air for all Ealing residents, in alignment with that of local residents’ campaign group <a href="https://southallandhayescleanair.org.uk/about/" title="About page for campaign group Clean Air for Southall and Hayes">Clean Air for Southall and Hayes</a> (CASH).</em></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-strategy-and-action-plan">Summary of the Strategy and Action Plan</h2>
<p>Ealing&rsquo;s draft air quality strategy&rsquo;s five stated priorities are to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce road traffic emissions</li>
<li>Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning</li>
<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments</li>
<li>Invest in green infrastructure</li>
<li>Raise awareness of air quality</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It would be useful to see the strategy and action plan follow the same structure with clear definitions of terms, and specific and detailed aims and objectives for each priority, along with baseline air pollution levels and equalities data for each in order to monitor and measure impact.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/8fc38abd8c.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport"></p>
<p>Somewhat confusingly, the action plan groups its actions into six categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Emissions from Developments and Buildings</li>
<li>Public health and awareness raising</li>
<li>Delivery servicing and freight</li>
<li>Borough fleet actions</li>
<li>Localised solutions</li>
<li>Cleaner transport</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This maybe because they are copied and pasted from the previous <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/4240/air_quality_action_plan_aqap">2017-22 action plan</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>It would be better for understanding, monitoring and evaluation to have consistency and coherence between the two documents, updating the action plan where necessary to reflect this.</strong></p>
<p>Also somewhat confusingly, Ealing&rsquo;s draft air quality strategy has nine stated goals, starting with the obvious. I&rsquo;ll say more on these later:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Improve air quality</li>
<li>Tackling the climate crisis</li>
<li>Fighting inequality</li>
<li>Protect biodiversity</li>
<li>Protect health and wellbeing</li>
<li>Raise public awareness</li>
<li>Promote sustainable infrastructure</li>
<li>Support the transition to clean energy</li>
<li>Creating good jobs</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inequalities">Inequalities</h3>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/30e2e26fd7.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint"></p>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk in Ealing&rsquo;s air quality strategy about being inclusive and &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; (&ldquo;reducing&rdquo; would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; (&ldquo;exhaust trail&rdquo; might be more apt?). I&rsquo;m not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="public-health-policy">Public Health Policy</h3>
<p>The strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks.</p>
<p><em>When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action</a>), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we&rsquo;ll see later, promoting active travel.</em></p>
<p>In contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio</a>).</p>
<p>*There&rsquo;s obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Good Growth</a>), and social policy (<a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Tackling Inequalities</a>).</p>
<p><strong>It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.</strong></p>
<p>The strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant.</p>
<p><em>Ealing&rsquo;s <a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profiles/2019/E09000009.html?area-name=Ealing">Health Profile from 2019</a> puts that figure in some context:</em></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/79dfdefa37.png" alt="Screenshot of Ealing&rsquo;s 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer" title="Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="air-pollution-in-ealing">Air Pollution in Ealing</h2>
<h3 id="pollution-sources">Pollution Sources</h3>
<p>The strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy.</p>
<p>Those most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women.</p>
<p><strong>It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo;, especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).</strong></p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.</em></p>
<p>The strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.</p>
<p><em>Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).</em></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/b3477cab4c.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning"></p>
<p><em>On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):</em></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/6301e51513.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter"></p>
<p><em>In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn&rsquo;t get a look-in at all, data from 2013.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/a517ab2e6a.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together" title="Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together"></p>
<p><strong>It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.</strong></p>
<p><em>The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council&rsquo;s key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.</em></p>
<p><strong>It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="air-quality-monitoring">Air Quality Monitoring</h3>
<p>The strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/601d0ed36b.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO"></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/pm2.5_in_london_october19.pdf" title="PDF">background levels of PM2.5</a> in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO&rsquo;s target.</em></p>
<p>The draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.</p>
<p>Ealing has 67 air quality monitors acrosss the borough, all recording levels of notrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulater matter (PM10 only).</p>
<p><em>It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although their are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as <a href="https://www.airqualityengland.co.uk/local-authority/?la_id=191" title="Air Quality England: Southall monitors">The Green Quarter</a>.</em></p>
<p>Ealing publishes annual air quality <a href="https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/Reports.aspx">status reports</a>.</p>
<p><em>Ealing also has <a href="https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/DiffusionTubes.aspx">an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites</a> where you can see graphical annual data summary charts. Unfortunately, none seem to have been updated since 2021.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/7736b00dee.png" alt="Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021" title="Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021"></p>
<p><strong>It would be useful to have more monitors for particulate matter, especially PM2.5, across the borough, and in Southall, and for published data from all air pollution monitors to be kept accessible and up-to-date.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="priorities-for-action">Priorities for Action</h2>
<p>Back to the strategy&rsquo;s priorities for action, and my <em>comments and questions</em>, and <strong>suggestions</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce road traffic emissions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The biggest reduction in road traffic emissions came during 2020 covid lockdowns, and while it&rsquo;s not practical, feasible or desirable to replicate that going forward, it might be worth promoting the idea that employers should encourage and support an increase to the 36% of Ealing&rsquo;s working age population already mainly <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/work/distance-travelled-to-work/workplace-travel-5a/works-mainly-from-home?lad=E09000009" title="2021 Census data on working from home in Ealing">working from home</a> whenever possible, as opposed to the current political groupthink that everyone must return to the office in order to be productive.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>There are two wood-burning incinerators close to my home, which frequently create disgusting burning plastic odours forcing us to stay indoors and close all our windows. Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council&rsquo;s response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn&rsquo;t give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Wouldn&rsquo;t this be fantastic?! Again, the Council&rsquo;s response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents&rsquo; needs for clean air first, and above developers&rsquo; desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Invest in green infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Southall has the least <a href="https://www.ealingitree.online/stories/canopy-cover/0" title="Tree canopy cover in Ealing">tree canopy cover in Ealing</a>, yet is subjected to <a href="https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns" title="Over-development of Southall">massive overdevelopment</a>. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.</em></p>
<p><em>The one concession negotiated hard for by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the &lsquo;reset&rsquo; button. Having sat on the Mayor&rsquo;s money and done nothing for so long it&rsquo;s no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new &lsquo;pocket park&rsquo; outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-&lsquo;orchards&rsquo; planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the &lsquo;Poison Park&rsquo; to look forward to, the &lsquo;green space&rsquo; crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.</em></p>
<p><strong>If the council&rsquo;s air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.</strong></p>
<p><em>Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a &lsquo;compromise&rsquo; to <a href="https://ealing.news/environment/environmentalists-tell-ealing-council-and-its-leader-peter-mason-their-actions-will-result-in-ecocide-and-are-environmentally-reckless-and-ecologically-illiterate-over-warren-farm-sports-p" title="Ealing News coverage of Warren Farm story">destroy most of the already re-wilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall</a> in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don&rsquo;t want. I don&rsquo;t understand how the Leader&rsquo;s desires complement the Council&rsquo;s stated strategies to reduce air pollution, tackle the climate emergency they declared, and to protect and promote biodiversity and our ecosystem.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Raise awareness of air quality.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The council also wants to (and must) lead by example.</em></p>
<p><strong>If the council really wants to lead by example on reducing air pollution, then the council Leader cannot accept or request car rides to or from meetings in Southall, councillors cannot park in cycle lanes in Southall, nor fly to the property developer festival in the south of France. They must engage with Southall residents suffering the worst of the air pollution from multiple sources, and stop denying or minimising the existence and extent of the problems, and proactively and collaboratively work to reduce or stop such pollution episodes continuing.</strong></p>
<p><em>Otherwise, the council&rsquo;s strategy isn&rsquo;t worth the virtual paper it&rsquo;s printed on, and is just more hot air.</em></p>
<p><em>What we have in the draft plan, however, is largely a copy-and-paste of the previous 2017-2022 plan, which was, at worst, a demonstrable failure of ambition, leadership and political will, and, at best, a simple failure of the council to do what it said it would do.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="strategy-goals">Strategy Goals</h2>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Improve air quality. Protect the health and wellbeing of Ealing residents from the harmful effects
of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) air pollution.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The strategy MUST have the inclusive goal of protecting residents from the harmful effects of ALL air pollutants (not just nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter).</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Tackling the climate crisis&hellip;. by aiming for the highest environmental standards.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The &ldquo;highest environmental standards&rdquo; must be clearly stated and defined.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Fighting inequality&hellip;. to ensure that no-one is left behind&hellip; [and] residents feel safe.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The strategy must ensure that inequalities are reduced, that ALL residents are included in this process, and that their concerns for the safety of their air are taken seriously and acted upon.</strong> <em>Promoting the uptake of expensive electric vehicles and discounting parking spaces for them is discriminating against economically deprived mostly non-white people who suffer most from air pollution.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Protect biodiversity. Ensuring our parks, open spaces and nature are protected and enhanced.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This is particularly relevant right now, as the Council Leader pushes on with his undemocratic desire to destroy much of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall, and killing off a quarter of London&rsquo;s endangered skylarks, in order to build new sports pitches and/or a football stadium.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Protect health and wellbeing. Protecting and enhancing the physical and mental health of all.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Except in Southall? <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/5214/public_health_england_-_southall_waterside_interim_health_risk_assessment">Public Health England&rsquo;s four risk assessment reports</a> into the Southall Gasworks poisoning clearly stated that &ldquo;Odours can cause nuisance amongst the population possibly leading to stress and anxiety. Some people may experience symptoms such as nausea, headaches or dizziness.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Raise public awareness. Promoting awareness of the causes and impacts of air quality issues, as well as the available local solutions&hellip;. encouraging community activism&hellip;.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Except in Southall? At every opportunity, Ealing Council has sought to erase, deny or minimise the the causes and impacts of air quality issues related to Southall Gasworks, refused to enforce any local solutions, and actively discouraged and attempted to prevent community activists&rsquo; voices from being heard.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>Promote sustainable infrastructure. Ensure local transport and development planning supports investment in sustainable infrastructure, that limits impact on air quality, enabling a shift to low-emission transport and energy options.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Except in Southall? The Council recently <a href="https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s1726/Southall%20Reset.pdf">decided NOT to widen the South Road bridge in Southall</a>. Widening the bridge, as promised, would ease congestion, and improve air quality, public transport and active travel options. The bridge widening was the one concession granted to the Southall community when the London Mayor overruled local democracy to give the go ahead to developement of the highly contaminated Southall Gasworks site.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>Support the transition to clean energy. Supporting the uptake of low-emission energy technologies and improvements in efficiencies, and reducing reliance on the consumption of fossil and solid fuels.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/14/electric-cost-lithium-mining-decarbonasation-salt-flats-chile" title="Guardian article about the environmental cost of lithium mining in Chile">in Chile</a>? Simply promoting and encouraging more (low emission) cars isn’t going to reduce congestion, emissions from brake and tyre wear, or help to reduce our “reliance on the consumption of fossil fuels”. Ealing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-62346322" title="BBC News story about electricity grid in Ealing not having enough capacity to power new home developments until 2030">reportedly doesn’t have enough power on the electricity grid for new homes until 2030</a>.</em></p>

<li>Creating good jobs. We want to&hellip; deliver an ambitious programme of building more genuinely affordable homes.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2 id="spotlight-on-southall">Spotlight on Southall</h2>
<p>These are all my comments, so I&rsquo;m not putting it all in <em>italics.</em></p>
<p>My suggestions and questions for the strategy are still in <strong>bold.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Southall cannot be used as a good example of how Ealing Council takes air pollution seriously.</strong></p>
<h3 id="inequalities-1">Inequalities</h3>

<p>Southall has a <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/identity/ethnic-group/ethnic-group-tb-20b/white-english-welsh-scottish-northern-irish-or-british?lad=E09000009" title="2021 Census data">BAME population of more than 90%</a>.</p>
<p>Southall Broadway/West and Southall Green are the two council wards that border the old Gasworks site, and which are downwind from the FM Conway asphalt and Tarmac plants, and the two wood-burning incinerators, depending on wind direction. They are connected by the Gasworks site and by the Air Quality Focus Area from South Road to The Green, King Street and Western Road.</p>

<p>Southall is already a high pollution area (and an Air Quality Focus Area as a result), but has several additive sources of unmitigated, uncontrolled air pollution.</p>
<p>Economically poorer, BAME people, children, older people and pregnant women are the most vulnerable to the health impacts of toxic air pollution. Certainly not a fairer start for Southall’s children.</p>
<p>We know from bitter experience over the last six years in Southall that the council has failed in its duty to protect some of its most vulnerable residents from harm.</p>
<h3 id="raising-awareness">Raising Awareness</h3>
<p>To add insult to injury, the council failed to raise public awareness of the risks and the air quality monitoring data in an open and transparent manner before work on the site began, and while the work was in progress. It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”. Residents were never informed if, when or how levels of naphthalene were urgently reduced.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/16631f69b8.png" alt="Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council&rsquo;s statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment" title="Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment"></p>
<p>It’s noteworthy that the Council claims it asked PHE to get involved only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031045353/https://www.ealing.gov.uk/news/article/2035/statement_on_phe_southall_waterside_risk_assessment" title="Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment">“following concerns raised by local residents”</a> and not because the Council itself carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment prior to works starting in 2016, knowing that the Southall population was significantly more vulnerable to air pollution due to high pre-existing levels and multiple inequalities.</p>
<p>Similarly, the council says it responded to residents&rsquo; concerns by installing &ldquo;independent&rdquo; air quality monitors on site in 2021, but this is five years after the work started, and two years after the main source of air pollution and odour complaints (the so-called soil &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;) was decommissioned. The monitors now installed record near-real time data for “urban background” emissions of odourless particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/e8d8fc3af0.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents&rsquo; concerns" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns"></p>
<p>The odours and air pollution that residents are concerned about originate from polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (i.e., the hundred years’ of toxic waste from town gas, coal tar and petrochemical work sites). We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!</p>
<h3 id="public-health">Public Health</h3>
<p>We are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. <strong>Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?</strong> The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?</p>
<p>Moreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years&rsquo; of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. <strong>Why wasn&rsquo;t truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?</strong></p>
<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?</p>
<p>The council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks. Indeed half of the plan was missing from the planning portal and <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/845384/response/2020637/attach/html/5/FOI%20Response%2022%200363%20FINAL.pdf.html" title="Freedom of Information Response from Ealing Council stating they don't have a copy of the original CMP for Southall Gasworks">the council admitted that it didn&rsquo;t have a full copy of the original CMP</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How on earth was the council planning to enforce a CMP it wasn’t in possession of?</strong> This was a gross dereliction of duty to care for the health and wellbeing of (by its own definition) the most vulnerable residents in the borough.</p>

<p><strong>The Council was committed to full enclosure of waste sites in its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan. Why wasn’t the one hundred years of petrochemical waste &ldquo;soil cleaning hospital” enclosed?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.southallgasholders.com/" title="National Grid's website for the Southall Gasholders detailing their use of a soil cleaning enclosure">National Grid have enclosed their enclosed their soil remediation work</a> specifically to avoid causing odour nuisance to the local community (and thanks no doubt to campaigning by local residents and activists at Clean Air for Southall and Hayes).</p>
<h3 id="on-whose-side">On Whose Side?</h3>
<p>Why did the former and current council leader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181229123356/http://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Councillors/tabid/63/ctl/ViewCMIS_Person/mid/383/id/19/ScreenMode/Alphabetical/Default.aspx" title="Internet Archive page of former Ealing Council Leader Julian Bell's declarations of gifts and hospitality from developers">accept over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group</a> to fly (!) to the south of France for what Private Eye Magazine describes as <a href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/dispatches-from-cannes-46501" title="Inside Housing article on the MIPIM property festival and Private Eye Magazine's description of it as a booze and hookerfest">a booze and hookerfest</a>?</p>
<p>The new council leader claims he went there to negotiate hard. If that&rsquo;s the case, what did he negotiate? He also claimed that it wasn&rsquo;t what he expected and that it was a mistake to go. If that&rsquo;s also the case, <a href="https://ealing.nub.news/news/local-news/former-ealing-council-housing-leader-admits-he-39made-a-mistake39-accepting-3000-from-developer-for-cannes-property-conference" title="Ealing Nub news article on current Ealing Council Leader Peter Mason's admission that accepting developers' gifts and hospitality was a mistake">why was it a mistake</a>?</p>
<p><strong>How can we be sure that the new council leader and his administration won&rsquo;t continue making these mistakes and taking the side of developers rather than standing up for the residents they are elected to represent?</strong></p>

<p><strong>If the soil is now clean and the air is safe to breathe, why would stopping works during hot weather (which didn’t happen in 2018), and covering stockpiles (why weren’t they covered already?) be given as examples of possible mitigating actions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>There must be a new commitment to work with and for residents where these are issues. Air pollution and odour nuisance reporting and investigation procedures need to be overhauled as they are currently not fit for purpose (reporting process too convoluted, each one investigated as a single, isolated incident rather than as part of an ongoing problem, residents are simply not believed and our reports are minimised and invalidated).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Work on the Gasworks site is due to complete in 2038. Why is the date for net-zero emissions set for twelve years after this date in 2050?</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a similar commitment to target zero-emissions for construction vehicles by 2040, which is two years after the new draft local Plan period for new developments ends.</p>

<p><strong>What has Ealing Council done to date to campaign for greater regulatory powers and for a Clean Air Act? Please give examples.</strong></p>
<p>This draft Air Quality Strategy is fine in many respects in terms of the words it contains, but what concerns me is that these are empty words if they are not acted on and enforced.</p>
<p>Recent history strongly suggests the council doesn&rsquo;t have the leadership, organisational culture or political will to act in the interests of its most vulnerable residents in Southall.</p>
<h3 id="active-travel">Active Travel</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about active travel and Ealing Council&rsquo;s multi-million pound Let&rsquo;s Go Southall campaign in the draft Strategy, but <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/825485/response/1997481/attach/html/5/FOI%20Response%2022%200079%20FINAL.pdf.html" title="Let's Go Southall Freedom of Information Request">very little on its real cost and impact</a>. They seem to have about 50 regular weekly activity groups. Over two years that&rsquo;s 5,000 sessions. 30,000 attendances (not individuals). So average of six people per session? 1,000 people attended at least two sessions (repeat attendances). My guess would be not many more than 1,000 in total, most will be repeaters (thinking GP referrals, lots of organisers?). If it&rsquo;s helped 1,000 individuals, that&rsquo;s £5,400 per person. If 10,000 it&rsquo;s £540 per person (still seems like a lot of money). And there&rsquo;s no evidence that it&rsquo;s helped anyone!</p>
<p><strong>The council must be open and transparent with residents that Let&rsquo;s Go Southall is a top-down neoliberal behavioural change (&ldquo;nudge theory&rdquo;) programme led by a retired stockbroker, and not the &ldquo;grassroots social movement&rdquo; of the council&rsquo;s Orwellian publicity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the Council is serious about improving safe active travel options in Southall, then it must improve road and pavement conditions and safety first. Many of the roads and pavements are not fit to cycle or walk on, especially for children and families, older people, and people with disabilities.</strong></p>

<h1 id="air-quality-action-plan">Air Quality Action Plan</h1>
<h2 id="the-2017-2022-action-plan">The 2017-2022 Action Plan</h2>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/da4994ee82.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution" title="Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution"></p>
<p>a. Included a number of no-or-low-impact schemes such as Low Emission Neighbourhoods (LENs), implemented in 2021 as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. <strong>Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/ffb64911e1.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don&rsquo;t reduce air pollution" title="Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution"></p>
<p>b. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. <strong>Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.</strong></p>
<p>c. Another low impact scheme was Play Streets. <strong>How many Play Streets are there now? How often do they run? Where are they?</strong></p>
<p>d. <strong>How many Pocket Parks are there? Where are they?</strong></p>
<p>e. <strong>How many Green Screens  are there? Where are they? Why were green screens not erected at Southall Gasworks even after residents complained of dust from the site in their homes?</strong></p>
<p>f. <strong>How are these schemes evaluated in terms of reducing air pollution? Where are the air quality monitors located to record baseline measurements to compare against air pollution levels during or after the scheme is in place?</strong></p>
<p>g. <strong>Enforcement of anti-idling laws was deemed &ldquo;not cost-effective&rdquo;. Smoke control was not deemed a problem and therefore not promoted or enforced. Who made these decisions?</strong></p>
<p>h. <strong>What is the wider &lsquo;cost&rsquo; to residents in not taking enforcement action against these criminal behaviours?</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-2022-2027-action-plan-aqap">The 2022-2027 Action Plan (AQAP)</h2>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/a6a7ae4c4e.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone"></p>
<p><strong>If air pollution monitoring data cannot inform the efficacy of individual actions, how can it be used in combination with secondary data to do so?</strong> I&rsquo;m sure there must be a sensible explanation, but to most people I suspect this statement makes little sense. In Southall, we have continuously been asked to ignore our own lived experience of health and quality of life problems attributed to the open-air &lsquo;cleaning&rsquo; of a hundred years of petrochemical waste at the Gasworks site, in favour of the developer Berkeley&rsquo;s assurances that it&rsquo;s own monitoring of air quality is &lsquo;within acceptable limits&rsquo; and harmless to health. Public Health England published four risk assessments based on Berkeley&rsquo;s data, and came to similar conclusions, although neither looked at any secondary data. The air pollution data has still to be published so that the public can make up their own minds.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/8b107c503e.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution"></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/4cd9b2f1fa.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how imperceptible changes that cannot be detected by monitoring or modelling can be interpreted as Low Impact or a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>The Action Plan here seems to contradict the Strategy by stating that changes in the levels of air pollution above a certain level can be attributed even to individual actions (although more likely to be due to multiple actions).</p>
<p><strong>If the council is serious about using air pollution data and secondary data to establish efficacy of its air quality strategy and action plan, (which sounds sensible enough), then it must explain what measures it will use, and publish baseline data and regular updates.</strong></p>
<p>Like it does with its <a href="https://ealingperformance.inphase.com/Plan/856" title="Ealing Council Performance Dashboard">performance dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the Council&rsquo;s own evaluation of it&rsquo;s 2017-22 Action Plan, I would suggest that it&rsquo;s achievements are minimal, and misleading.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/2af9af507b.png" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan"></p>
<p>Electric Vehicle charging points (p. 30 of 2022 AQAP) were not actually a specified target in the 2017 AQAP, so I&rsquo;m unsure how this can be claimed as an achievement? Similarly with School Streets and specific cycle lanes. LENS/LTNs were specified as a target, but there is no mention of that fiasco here. <strong>Air quality monitoring data must be used to locate pollution hotspots for any future implementation of LENs/LTNs</strong></p>
<p>The 20 mph speed limit was implemented borough-wide, but only since December 2021. Why did it take so long? What is the use of it if it isn’t enforced, especially in Southall?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There will be 14,800 new homes in 23 new developments in Southall over the next few years. 14 units over 10 stories high, and 7 over 20 stories high. Up to 40,000 new residents (and their cars)!</p>
<p>One third of the total new developments in the whole of Ealing borough (only Acton is getting it worse).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So not happening so much in the &lsquo;white&rsquo; or richer areas of the borough, for some reason.</p>
<p>None of these homes will be genuinely affordable to most people currently living in overcrowded homes in Southall or Ealing, as Studio bedsit flats start at around £300,000!</p>
<p>Most will stay empty until they are sold to investors from China, Malaysia, Singapore, Bahrain(!) where they are actively marketed by the greedy property developers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The same property developers who gave former Ealing Council &lsquo;Leader&rsquo; Julian Bell and new Ealing Council &lsquo;Leader&rsquo; Peter Mason (also a Southall Green ward councillor) over £30,000 in recent years to holiday in the south of France at the MIPIM property festival in Cannes described as a &ldquo;booze &rsquo;n&rsquo; hookerfest&rdquo; by Private Eye Magazine.</p>
<p>Bell says, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t cost the taxpayer a penny&rdquo;, but in Southall we are already paying with our health and quality of life thanks to the poisonous air from the development of the contaminated old gasworks site (due to complete in 2038!).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Town planner Mason says it was a mistake, and not what he expected(!).</p>
<p>Where will 40,000 new residents&rsquo; children go to school (and how will they get there and back), how will they get an appointment to see a GP, which hospital will they go to when they need emergency treatment, and how will they get there on the roads already regularly gridlocked by too much traffic?</p>
<p>Worth taking the time to have a look at <a href="https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns.">stopthetowers.info/other-cam&hellip;</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Cllr Mason recommended we read Bob Colenutt&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Property Lobby: The Hidden Reality Behind the Housing Crisis&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>What Colenutt says (and he has a wealth of experience in local authority housing and planning, and in the community resisting property developers), is that developers do have too much power (as Mason argues), but also that local councils and councillors do not do enough to resist, do not have the negotiating skills (contrary to how Mason originally described the importance of trips to MIPIM to &rsquo;negotiate hard&rsquo;), and too readily embrace the &lsquo;financialisation&rsquo; of the land and property market brought about by David Cameron&rsquo;s and Nick Clegg&rsquo;s ConDem government in 2010.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So now, we have a very real housing crisis fuelling the huge profits of private developers, all facilitated and egged on by mostly Labour councils too easily rolling over and allowing them to build fewer and fewer &lsquo;genuinely affordable homes&rsquo; (because &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the profit in that?&rdquo;).</p>
<p>What Colenutt says loudly and clearly is that without ordinary people&rsquo;s and communities&rsquo; resistance it would be so much worse, and that to all intents and purposes councils and councillors are in bed with the developers.</p>

<p>Body:</p>
<p>On 13 December Zarah Sultana MP  is presenting the #FreeSchoolMealsForAll Bill in Parliament.</p>
<p>The bill would extend Free School Meals to every child in primary school. It would support families and help ensure every child has the basics to grow and thrive.</p>
<p>MPs should back families, back children, and back the bill.</p>
<p>I’ve just asked my MP to back the Bill. Can you ask your MP to do the same?</p>

<p>Took me an hour (as opposed to 10 minutes) to drive my lad home from school this afternoon, thanks in part to the High Traffic Neighbourhood (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18k_2hRx7EC4ov1mVrzH0GzV3v-6hUH4W/view?usp=sharing">&lsquo;Improving access for HGVs&rsquo;</a>) in Southall &lsquo;Green&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Like a rat, I tried the side streets and back roads option and found those to be jammed, too, and Scotts Road - although confusingly still two-way throughout - is now No Entry from the eastern end.</p>
<p>I would have abandoned my car and got out and walked/scooted home, but there was nowhere to leave it - all the pavements (and even the double yellow lines) were parked on, or being used by, er, pedestrians.</p>
<p>The more virtuous brothers and sisters amongst us may righteously question why me and my lad weren&rsquo;t scooting/walking anyway? Why are we driving when Southall is known for its traffic gridlock?</p>
<p>We have done it a couple of times. It takes us 40 minutes each way in fine weather. My lad would love to do it every day, I&rsquo;m sure, although not in the wind, cold and rain. I don&rsquo;t believe my dodgy feet/knees/hips/back would manage it daily, either.</p>
<p>And why are we going to a school so far away from where we live?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the best (and happiest) school in Southall. And it&rsquo;s the one that is furthest away from the gasworks stink and toxic air. We wanted to give our little asthmatic boy some clean air five days a week, if we could. (Of course, we since found out the school is under the Heathrow flight path, and next to the smoky narrowboats moored on the canal&hellip;.).</p>
<p>(In case you are wondering, the ambulance somehow squeezed down the middle of Western Road, fortunately no well-intentioned bollards or planters in the way.)</p>

			 <p>I returned to work last week after my extended absence due to respiratory illness, which may or may not be related to three years of breathing the poisonous gasworks&rsquo; air.</p>
<p>I find I now have to literally climb over two rough sleepers camped outside the door of my workplace in order to get in. There is no more space in the nearby doorway, and the doorway around the side entrance is similarly occupied.</p>
<p>By my reckoning, we have five more rough sleepers than we did two months ago, or two years ago, or four years ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Southall&rsquo;s skyline is rapidly changing from terraced family houses to much-needed &lsquo;genuinely affordable&rsquo; skyscraper studio flats, while &lsquo;parklets&rsquo; are opening up in the posher parts of Ealing.</p>
<p>To be fair, I did see that the Bell regime have cut a deal with Compton&rsquo;s foldaway bikes so that residents on the Copley estate can hire them without having to pay a membership fee, and improve air quality at the same time.</p>

Until now. A year later. But only for backers, for the time being (see footnote 1). I had a listen this morning, and, really, it sounds great.

<p>Lastly I&rsquo;d like to wish all three of my dedicated listeners a very Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year. On the publishing frequency of this podcast, if you would like me to give it to you annually, please leave a comment below, and I will do my best to ignore it.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When I grow up, I want to play football for Manchester United!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an eight year old boy growing up in rural Lincolnshire in the 1970s it seemed like an honest and rational response to an impossible question. No one else at my school wanted to play football for Manchester United. Leeds, maybe. Liverpool, definitely. Other kids said they wanted to be firemen, soldiers, doctors, and nurses. More of that later. Maybe their parents <em>were</em> firemen? Or maybe not. I didn&rsquo;t know what my parents were. My dad went out before I got up every morning, and came home after I went to bed. At weekends, he told me stories about George Best, Denis Law (his favourite), Bobby Charlton, and the Busby Babes. About Manchester United and how they had the best team and had the best players. Not any more. That was all before my time. I was born in the year United had won the League for the last time, the year before they went on to win the European Cup. The Glory Days. Now, in my time, United were in Division Two (although I didn&rsquo;t understand what that meant at the time). What I did understand was that I got to see highlights on Yorkshire TV occasionally, with a young and annoying Martin Tyler commentating on matches against the likes of &rsquo;local&rsquo; teams Hull City, Sheffield Wednesday and York City. United were good that season. Stuart Pearson was my favourite then. Stocky and powerful, he played with the passion that I came to expect from United players. He was never the best, but he scored goals and looked like he meant it. I meant it when I said I wanted to be a footballer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Think of something realistic,&rdquo; I was told.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never make it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Concentrate on your studies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t wait to prove them wrong.</p>
<p>I got in to the school team. In games lessons and playtime, I was a stocky and powerful centre forward who scored goals. Our first proper match was against another village school.</p>
<p>Five years later, in big school, I&rsquo;d had my chips pissed on, but I still wanted to make it. I wrote to East Stirlingshire Football Club (just before a young Alex Ferguson took charge) offering my services. I got a polite rejection letter back.</p>
<p>No one ever told me why. I was too upset to ask.</p>
<p>Later, in Art class, I put together a morbid collage of war and that terrible question in cut-out newspaper headline letters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so childish!&rdquo; the teacher scolded me when he woke from his alcoholic stupor.</p>
<p>Well, pardon me. I <em>was</em> a child. Surely I was allowed to ask, and expect an adult answer?</p>
<p>So instead, I told them I wanted to join the Army. Not because I wanted to, but because that seemed to keep them happy.</p>
<p>Later still, when approaching school leaving age, after filling in countless forms asking me what I liked doing and what I was good at, I was told by a &lsquo;careers advisor&rsquo; to study chemical or electrical engineering at university. I didn&rsquo;t know what they were or why they&rsquo;d been chosen for me. I resolved to go on the dole.</p>

			 <p>Abstract: Anally probed with a four metre long tube.
Tags: alien, abduction, colonoscopy, humour, personal</p>
<p>Last week I was abducted by aliens.</p>
<p>I was woken at dawn by my alarm clock to find a bright light shining in through the window. As if in a trance, I found myself drawn towards the light and compulsively (as I do every morning) drew the curtains.</p>
<p>I felt a presence in the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Turn your alarm off, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; said my wife.</p>
<p>I felt a non-human presence in the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miaow&rsquo; said the cat.</p>
<p>I found myself getting washed and dressed and heading out the door, as if I had an appointment to be somewhere. After a brisk twenty minute walk, I found myself right inside the massive, shiny metallic spacecraft, which appeared to have landed slap bang in the middle of a car park. I felt no fear, although I was a little apprehensive. I entered the craft and was transported up into its upper level via some kind of elevator.</p>
<p>I have blogged before about my experiences of abduction and how aliens <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2010/04/24/confessions-of-a.html">harvested my organs</a> and <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2010/05/25/waterboarding-on-the.html">tortured me</a>, so this was nothing new. I felt a familiar apprehension as I caught sight of one of my abductors, a short woman in a green uniform.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pEt-4yxqW58/UDLEH61DMrI/AAAAAAAAsek/0VzWzH-bWhE/s400/Signs-of-Colon-Cancer-inside-view-image1.jpg" alt="Courtroom sketch-style re-enactment of an alien probing my anus" title="Courtroom sketch-style re-enactment of an alien probing my anus"></p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you like an enema before we start?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;A glass of water would be nice,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;Do you need to go?&rsquo; she asked me rather sternly this time. &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to be back in time for the football.&rsquo; Now in something of a huff, she handed me a green paper gown to wear, which appeared to have been designed for tailed creatures. I followed her through to what looked like an operating theatre where I was surrounded by three little green men with surgical implements and machines which went &lsquo;BLEEP!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They made me lie on a table and paralysed me by injecting something into my hand. One of the aliens stuck his finger up my back passage and said, &lsquo;This might hurt a little bit.&rsquo; Then they made me pass out by gassing me. I awoke sometime later to find the aliens withdrawing a four metre long tube from my rear end. &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel a thing.&rsquo; I was as high as a kite. They handed me back to my wife on a piece of string and told her, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let go of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RSHGtLaKdjs/UDLEI-PCA6I/AAAAAAAAse0/yLdQ_eB68_Q/s400/alienjulez1.jpg" alt="Doctors and nurses prepare for my colonoscopy" title="Doctors and nurses prepare for my colonoscopy"></p>
<p>Somewhat bizarrely, they also gave me a piece of paper describing the contents of my colon - nothing at all in there save a few pesky piles.</p>
<p>What a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bleeding-from-the-bottom-rectal-bleeding/" title="If you have a bloody bottom, please go see your doctor.">bloody relief</a>!</p>

			 <p>I received some customer feedback.</p>
<p>A Welsh reader writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You disgust me!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not at all shocked or surprised. I disgust myself, frequently. Thanks for validating my experience.</p>
<p>A Mr Tim Savage of Stratford Jobcentre writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get a job!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t at all shocked or surprised. My doctor had been signing me off sick (not fit for work) for a while. So long, in fact, that my ex-employer, quite rightly, gave up on me ever returning to &lsquo;my&rsquo; hot desk. In employment legalese, I was dismissed through being incapable of work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Big Tim had helpfully been sending me enough money to live on every two weeks for a while, and in return I kept sending him my sick notes from my doctor.</p>
<p>But I guess Tim&rsquo;s goodwill was running out. He asked me to fill in a questionnaire about my health and asked me to visit Norman, a nurse, so that two months after losing my job because I was incapable of work due to ill health, Norman could assess my capability for work.</p>
<p>Norman asked me lots of questions and asked me to move my arms about as if I was directing small aircraft in to land. He was ever so nice about it. It felt a bit like being interviewed by that very nice SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa chap off the telly, except no one came rushing in afterwards to brutally machine gun to death the people downstairs after we were done. Which was nice.</p>
<p>Anyway. As a result of Norman&rsquo;s niceness and despite me failing to safely land any aircraft due to my two frozen shoulders, Tim decided that I was capable of work after all, and told me so. And although Tim recognised that I have an illness or disability, he wasn&rsquo;t going to send me any more money to live on unless I appealed, actively started looking for work, or appealed.</p>
<p>All of this made me feel rather like a terrible burden on society and that society might be just a whole lot better off without me around dragging it down. And I had been feeling really pretty suboptimal anyway.</p>
<p>So I went back to my doctor, who signed me off sick again and gave me some anti-depressants and painkillers, and decided that of the three options given to me - appeal, look for work, or appeal - I would like to appeal. Tim wrote back straight away saying that he would send me some more money to live on as long as I send him my sick notes from my doctor. Seems fair enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite a difficult juggling act. On the one hand trying to get better, to get well again. On the other, remaining ill enough to be eligible for handouts. The last few months I&rsquo;ve been rapidly deteriorating, hitting a new low, barely able to speak to anyone even online. Most of the time, I simply don&rsquo;t feel like I have anything to say.</p>
<p>That said, I have some good days, and I have now almost completed my assessments for psychotherapy and expect to start in a group sometime in the new year. At my last session, the therapist said it seemed like I&rsquo;d been depressed all my life, but only now (well, two years ago) asked for help. Thanks for validating my experience.</p>
<p>I had a good day yesterday, a good morning, at least, and decided to put it to use. So I carefully crafted for you, my dear reader, a veritable Christmas cracker of a musical podcast. Perhaps a cracker that doesn&rsquo;t crack and contains no party hat or plastic toy, but only a lame joke, but a cracker nonetheless.</p>
<p>And here, containing my best charidee radio DJ voice, it is:</p>

			 <p>Abstract: Gertcha by the wiener.
Tags: fireworks, photos, video, bier, Chas &rsquo;n&rsquo; Dave, hot dogs</p>
<p>Last night, eight of us from <a href="http://enfieldclubhouse.org.uk/">Enfield Clubhouse</a> went to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121012035305/http://www.alexandrapalace.com/news/no-fireworks-at-ally-pally-this-year/">Alexandra Palace to see London&rsquo;s largest and most popular fireworks display</a>. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wa8f7jGQiOw">a video I took</a>. The fireworks were pretty and spectacular - worth seeing, if you like that kind of thing!</p>
<p>After the fireworks, we climbed up the hill to the Palace itself and queued to get into the German Bier Festival. To call it a Festival is really a big overstatement. It&rsquo;s a few years since I went to a beer festival and it was most likely Up North in deepest, darkest Bury, Lancashire, or somewhere like that. Maybe they do them differently Down South, but this was a bit of a let down. One tiny little bar, like you might find in a marquee at a modern marketed music festival. One brand of German Bier - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulaner">Paulaner</a> - and only two varieties: Munich and Weiss. The Weiss was off by the time I had been pushed and shoved forward by the ten deep bar queue. If you didn&rsquo;t fancy Paulaner Munich, you could have that old Bavarian favourite, Foster&rsquo;s. And they insisted on calling it Bier, which makes me wonder how authentic it really was. Not that authenticity seemed to be high on the agenda as it was all served in the obligatory health and safety plastic beakers.</p>
<p>So, we all got beer and seats in the Great Hall by which time a bunch of Cockney Irish fiddlers and banjoists started murdering Pogues&rsquo; classics, much to the delight of the mostly student audience who I&rsquo;m sure were out of their minds by now. Not that it stopped one of the thieving little tykes nicking my beer when I laid it down to rest and turned my back for five minutes.</p>
<p>What followed is a little hazy - maybe the bier was real, after all.</p>
<p>I fear that I may have danced to Chas But Not Dave or Chas And His Band or whatever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chas_%26_Dave" title="Chas &amp; Dave on Wikipedia">Chas &rsquo;n&rsquo; Dave</a> are now known as. I was a little disturbed by the large, bald bass player, especially when he kept repeating &lsquo;Gertcha!&rsquo; like an overly loud belch, totally drowning out scrawny-looking Chas on vocals.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, on leaving, I stopped for a Hot Dog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Sorry, no onions&rsquo; said the serving assistant.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a shame. I like onions on my Hot Dog. So. They are £3.00 with onions, right?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir, but we don&rsquo;t have any onions left.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. So, if it&rsquo;s £3.00 with onions&hellip; how much is it for a Hot Dog without onions?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s £3.00, sir. With or without onions.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By this time I was already in full Basil Fawlty mode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d like a discount, please. If it&rsquo;s £3.00 for a Hot Dog with onions, then I&rsquo;d like 20% off for a Hot Dog without onions.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s £3.00, sir. With or without onions.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;How can it be the same price, with or without onions?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s £3.00, sir. With or without onions.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;So, can I have a discount, then or not? I&rsquo;m willing to pay £2.40 for a Hot Dog without onions. If only you&rsquo;d removed the empty onion trays and not told me you had no onions I&rsquo;d never have known. Or you could scrape up the remaining slivers and let me have those&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I felt like Yossarian in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22">Catch-22</a> trying to get out of the Air Force by being crazy, but being told that he couldn&rsquo;t be crazy because he wanted to leave. And only a sane man would want to leave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir, there&rsquo;s nothing I can do. I can&rsquo;t give a discount. I just work here. It&rsquo;s £3.00, sir. With or without onions.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;You could give me a discount if you wanted to. I&rsquo;m sure you could.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The guy (no pun intended) behind me piped up, offering to call the Office Of Fair Trading. I suggested that they might want to consult the Sale Of Consumer Goods Act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t give a discount, sir. It&rsquo;s £3.00, with or without onions.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;OK, I give in. I&rsquo;ll have a Hot Dog without onions for £3.00.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;You have to pay first, sir.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;What?! But you just gave him one! He hasn&rsquo;t paid yet!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir. You have to pay first and then I&rsquo;ll give you the Hot Dog.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A young American woman approached me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Please stop harassing my staff, sir.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;What?! Harassing your staff?! You&rsquo;ve got to be joking?!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir. You&rsquo;re harassing my staff. Now, please stop it or I will have to call Security to come and remove you.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;All I want is a Hot Dog with onions for £3.00 as advertised. If you don&rsquo;t have onions, then fine, I&rsquo;ll buy a bareback Hot Dog for £2.40.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, you can buy a Hot Dog without onions for £3.00 or go without.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t you give me a discount?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I only work here, sir. I can&rsquo;t give you a discount.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Hang on. I thought you were in charge? Surely you can use your discretion and keep your customers happy? I just spent plenty of money tonight on donating to the cost of the fireworks display and buying beer for me and my friends.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your problem, mate?&rsquo; asked a student grumpily and who looked like he had dyed his original wiry ginger hair black. &lsquo;It says Hot Dogs £3.00. Doesn&rsquo;t say anything about onions.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;No, I know it doesn&rsquo;t say anything about onions. That&rsquo;s a very good point. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not going to engage you in any further conversation. Enjoy your Hot Dog! Thank you all and goodnight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thanks also, to Lee, Gemma, Michael, Atul, Dan, Raheem and Angelina for making it a fun night out. And my apologies for any offence caused to the Hot Dog stand workers.</p>

<p>On Saturday night, I shared a bonfire - in honour of the last person to enter the UK Parliament with honest intentions - with three Bolivians (all of whom have jobs, and at least one of whom has a cat), a Pole, a Catalan, an Irishman, several English people (one of Asian extraction and one born in Africa), a Roman candle or two, a Chinese lantern, twelve Lincolnshire sausages, some French’s American mustard, a large bag of <em>pomme de terres</em> of Peruvian ancestry, and a guy that looked like <a href="http://www.franksidebottom.co.uk" title="Frank Sidebottom">Frank Sidebottom</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and - long-time readers of my blog who have not yet required a psychotherapeutic intervention will be pleased to note - <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2011/11/08/no-onions-but.html">some onions</a>.</p>
<p>The onions went down particularly well. I fried them myself. They were so good, people asked me ‘How did you make them?’. ‘I fried them,’ I said. Did I sweat them, or cook them slowly? Not deliberately. There was a lot of them. No, I have never made French onion soup.</p>
<p>I also cooked the sausages. All I did was put them under the grill and turn them over occasionally, in between supping hot mulled wine in our neighbours’ garden and nipping back across the close to knock back some warm English ale and make sure our house wasn’t on fire. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s also when they burned <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Frank<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guy. So, sorry, no pics. (I also conducted a thought experiment about making a vegetarian alternative to sausages.)</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hjsO6HGfpbQ/UDLEGOik5QI/AAAAAAAAsd4/8YoFniXm5so/s400/Lantern_20committe.jpg" alt="Lantern committee.jpg" title="UN lantern committee"></p>
<p>One of the Bolivians wrapped the <em>pomme de terres</em> in tin foil and buried them in the burning embers of the bonfire to cook while a committee of English people tried to work out how to set the Chinese lantern alight. The token environmental activist present complained that setting a Chinese lantern alight wasn’t very environmentally friendly, and to be honest, I had some sympathy with her. Still, we were getting drunk, and this Chinese lantern was going up, one way or another. And up it went.</p>
<p>Perhaps the launching committee might have considered the location of the launchpad - well, actually, they did. ‘There’s a park five minutes walk from here,’ I said. ‘We’re not going there,’ they said. So, finally, we lit and launched the lantern in the close, and it rose up and up. Up and straight into the tree. Where it stayed, burning away in amongst the damp Autumn leaves. It’s still there now.</p>

<p>We burned some more pallets on the fire and then dug out the apples of the earth with a spade. The foil came off some of them in the process, to reveal glowing red potato coals within. Someone expertly cut the spuds in half and applied butter to the hot flesh, and passed them around with napkins and spoons. It was the best tasting potato I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>

		<a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2011/01/20/twenty-ten-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-01-20 23:00:00 &#43;0000">Jan 20, 2011</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Originally intended as a follow-up to <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2011/01/05/twenty-ten-part.html">part one of my milk-based food product styled personal review of 2010</a>, this post quickly regressed into a metaphorical guide to the cheesemaking process, as you will see.</p>
<p>By the end of the first week of March 2010, I felt like I was several thousand feet above sea level.  High up a mountain, again, perhaps mostly due to the ever-decreasing capacity of my right lung, but plummeting to new emotional depths thanks to the leaden weights of my ever-increasing self-doubt and sense of despair, perhaps partly as a reaction to stopping taking my antidepressant medication (although I stopped because I was feeling worse, not better).</p>
<p>One of the problems I found with officially going a bit mental is that I started to lose all confidence and trust in myself and the rest of the world. I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that I&rsquo;ve always been a bit of an independent-minded so-and-so and generally not afraid to say out loud whatever comes into my head. This invariably leads to me getting punched in the face. Or some other non-violent conflict.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-cheese">The Big Cheese</h2>
<p>A few years ago, I worked for someone who was responsible for making the lives of a few of her staff abjectly miserable, quite contrary to our organisation&rsquo;s stated <em>raison d&rsquo;être</em> &lsquo;for better mental health.&rsquo; It appeared that she would move from one person to another and to another and then, it seemed to me, it was my turn. I decided I wasn&rsquo;t going to take it.</p>
<p>During a torrid six months as her primary target, I had to undergo hospital tests on my heart for still unexplained and not since repeated vomiting and blackouts. When I told my GP what was going on at work she immediately signed me off with stress and didn&rsquo;t want me to go back when I did. By the time my boss had finished with me I was unemployed and unemployable. Never underestimate the power of a bully.</p>
<p>I learned from painful experience quite a lot about how bullies and psychopaths operate. I learned that, while part of me wants to stand up to them and expose them for what they are, the sane part of me wants to avoid them altogether. So when I did manage to find a new job with a decent manager and then moved on from that with a good reference into my current post four years ago, I was delighted to be in a position where I was &rsquo;the boss&rsquo;, although, of course, I still had to report to a management committee made up of volunteers, led by a truly wonderful Chair.</p>
<p>When I say I was glad to be in charge, I don&rsquo;t say that because of any desire to have power over others. Quite the contrary, in fact (unless I&rsquo;m deluding myself). I&rsquo;ve always believed in sharing power and responsibility as much as possible, but you can&rsquo;t do that if you have an egomaniac boss or a rigidly hierarchical organisational structure. Yes, there are differences between staff and service users (staff get paid being the main one), but I try to minimise these as far as I can.</p>
<h2 id="cheese-grating">Cheese Grating</h2>
<p>It was also gratifying to work in a London borough that not only funded my new organisation&rsquo;s work, but whose commissioners seemed genuinely supportive. Within two weeks of me starting my new job, however, it was grating to be informed that the local authority would be able to fund us for only 40% of what we had budgeted for on their advice of just three months earlier. My first significant and highly unpleasant task, therefore, was to have to ask staff to reduce their hours from full-time to two days a week or to make them redundant in order that the organisation could survive.</p>
<p>Over the next two years, we began to flourish and I was able to bring in external funding to supplement the local authority&rsquo;s money so that we could provide a still much-reduced service to what we had originally planned. Even so, it seemed popular with members, staff were highly skilled and dedicated to their work and feedback from carers and professionals who referred people to us was without exception, I think, almost worryingly positive.</p>
<h2 id="cheese-ripening">Cheese Ripening</h2>
<p>By working together on daily household and business tasks, we had established a sense of community, friendships and social engagement from a safe and supportive workplace. A lifeline for people whose experience was often one of many years of loss of sense of self and worth and an absence of meaningful relationships and occupation. A second home, where they were welcomed back with warmth and kindness into the human family (cite Richard Bentall&rsquo;s &lsquo;Doctoring The Mind&rsquo;) and encouraged to believe that they had real reasons to hope for - and expect - better lives.</p>
<p>We had people going out into the community to volunteer and set up our own catering service to employ some of our members in very part-time casual work, based on their existing skills and interests. For all but one, this was the first paid work they had done in years. We weren&rsquo;t able to find anyone permanent full-time employment during a time of global recession, but still I felt proud of what we&rsquo;d achieved in difficult circumstances and with fairly limited resources.</p>
<h2 id="cheese-induced-nightmare">Cheese-Induced Nightmare</h2>
<p>So when I attended our annual review in 2009 with our main funder and described what we did and the impact it had on people&rsquo;s lives I was gobsmacked to be told &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t care what you do or how you do it. We just want people off benefits and into work.&rsquo; I felt physically sick and faint.</p>
<p>While I understand (and, in principle, support) government targets to help people with disabilities to return to work, I&rsquo;ve always been sceptical about the management-theory driven obsession with outcomes and, worse, the introduction of outcome-based contracting - where service providers get paid only if they meet agreed targets. What happens, is that the largest national providers are able to tender for local contracts with the lowest unit cost, inevitably, in my opinion, sacrificing quality (process) in the name of quantity (outcomes). Except that they fail to deliver.</p>
<h2 id="processed-cheese">Processed Cheese</h2>
<p>To me, what we do and how we do it - the process - is of fundamental importance. There are plenty of organisations who work in completely different ways and who consistently fail to get people with diagnoses of schizophrenia (who form 60% of our membership) off benefits and into work and who receive considerably larger sums of money for doing so, making their CEO&rsquo;s rich (and famous) in the process. Pushing people who lack confidence and don&rsquo;t feel ready to work into inappropriate and unsupported employment simply doesn&rsquo;t work for most and carries the very real risk of being detrimental to their mental health.</p>
<p>In order to massage their figures, these organisations &lsquo;cherry-pick&rsquo; or &lsquo;cream&rsquo; the most able and likely to find employment while &lsquo;parking&rsquo; those with the most complex needs and severe disabilities, the very people small, local organisations like mine tend to work with. This is not to say that these people are not able. My experience tells me that indeed they are, but that they require much longer to build up sufficient confidence and trust and need much more support to do so. Time and support costs money, but so does a lifetime of unemployment and welfare dependence, not to mention the personal and social costs of inactive and isolated lives.</p>
<h2 id="cheesed-off">Cheesed Off</h2>
<p>Well, that was a rather long-winded way of saying that in 2009 I began to feel that I was being fucked about at work. What I believed to be the right way of working and what I was being told to do by my paymasters conflicted and didn&rsquo;t make any sense to me. A year later, while I had time on my hands due to my own physical and mental illness I &lsquo;discovered&rsquo; that evaluations of the way I was being told to work clearly stated that this approach doesn&rsquo;t work, either. I felt angry for not trusting my own judgment (based on experience and advice from mentors) and felt like I&rsquo;d been bullied into submission, yet again.</p>
<p>Join me for another cheese and whine morning next time.</p>

<p><a href="http://identi.ca/notice/17913585" title="Happy New Year!">I began 2010</a> by wishing everyone (except fascists) a Happy New Year and a promise to blog my reflections on the naughty decade in due course.</p>
<p>Well, that will have to wait for another time, but here - thanks to my <a href="http://identi.ca/dvdmrsdn" title="My identi.ca timeline">identi.ca memory aid</a> - are my reflections on 2010.</p>
<p>After recovering from <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/17914967" title="Hiccup!">hiccups</a>, <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/17918147" title="New Year greetings in Gaelic">speaking in tongues</a>, a <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/17959248" title="Ugh!">hangover</a> the size of every Xmas and New Year and forced communication with <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/18014870" title="I am not a man">O2&rsquo;s customer service drones</a>, I went back to work and set about the urgent task of building a <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/18304359" title="All work and no play...">snowwoman</a> in the front garden.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-F3qEZoqywcQ/UDLEVN-cHvI/AAAAAAAAsi8/lW-d-zz6PJM/s400/snowwoman1.jpg" alt="" title="Rolling my own snowwoman"></p>
<p>This was my equal opportunities response the the much celebrated <a href="http://identi.ca/tag/snowcock" title="identi.ca notices tagged with #snowcock">#SnowCock</a> (replete with massive snowballs) of Glossop erected by <a href="http://identi.ca/tdobson" title="Tim Dobson on identi.ca">Tim Dobson</a> and friends.</p>

<h2 id="heaven-snows-hes-miserable-now"><strong>Heaven snows he&rsquo;s miserable now</strong></h2>
<p>Snowwoman somehow ended up transgendering into #<a href="http://identi.ca/tag/snowmorrissey" title="identi.ca notices tagged with #SnowMorrissey">SnowMorrissey</a> until he inevitably lost his head, prompting a <a href="http://identi.ca/conversation/18482782" title="Andy C's lyrical tribute to #SnowMorrissey on identi.ca">lyrical tribute</a> from the similarly all-white and undead <a href="http://identi.ca/andyc" title="A drug-crazed zombie caked in flour">Andy C</a>.</p>
<p>Just as life imitates art, &lsquo;real&rsquo; life inevitably imitates life online. Perceptively and spookily - leaving aside the evidence of my maniacal online rantings - <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/18489204" title="Andy C expressing his concern for my mental well-being on identi.ca">Andy C was concerned for my mental health</a>.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m honest, my most recent mental breakdown occurred somewhat earlier. Without wishing to go into too much detail and bore anyone with my personal troubles, I had been speaking with a psychotherapist since September 2009. After a few sessions, she expressed her concern that I might be &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_II_disorder" title="Wikipedia article on Bipolar II disorder">bipolar II</a>&rsquo; and asked me to see my GP in order to get a referral to a psychiatrist for an assessment. I felt pretty shocked to hear this as I&rsquo;d never considered that I might have had any hypomanic episodes (let alone needed to see a shrink) even though that might have explained some of my problems.</p>
<p>In tears, I told my GP what my psychotherapist had said, and thus I began my own pharmaceutical research into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant#Therapeutic_efficacy" title="Wikipedia article on the efficacy of anti-depressants">effectiveness of anti-depressant medications</a> to give me some respite (my GP&rsquo;s word) from my heightened and unstable emotional state. My GP also referred me for a psychiatric assessment.</p>
<p>Mightily relieved finally to have spoken to someone about my difficulties and for allowing myself to ask for help, I felt as high as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temptation_of_Christ#3._Mountain" title="The Temptation of Christ on the mountain">Jesus on the mountain for forty days and nights</a>. Looking back now, it&rsquo;s perhaps significant that my <a href="http://identi.ca" title="identi.ca public timeline">identi.ca</a> output during this time was the highest it&rsquo;s ever been (according to <a href="http://identi.ca/macno" title="Michele on identi.ca">Michele</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.macno.org/denticator" title="Denticator - identi.ca user statistics">Denticator</a> - unfortunately it only shows the last 12 months, so you will have to take my word on that). Interestingly, my output last month, since I&rsquo;ve been feeling better and like my &rsquo;normal&rsquo; self was just as high if not higher:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jWXEKlbph78/TirPThCgDxI/AAAAAAAAppk/AkST3y7r-LM/s800/421527f662cf33118544603402c400b7-300x211.jpg" alt="" title="My Denticator stats for 2010"></p>
<p>I also increased my <a href="http://anotherurl.info" title="I haz a blog">long-form blogging</a> output, with a serious intent to try to write more regularly and have some fun in doing so. Perhaps significantly, my first post during this high period was about <a href="http://anotherurl.info/social-isolation-causes-andor-compounds-mental-health-problems" title="Social isolation causes and/or compounds mental health problems">mental health</a>.  I wrote eight proper blog posts in those forty days and nights including:</p>

<p>It had taken me nine months to write my previous eight proper blog posts and almost five months to write the next eight. I wrote only one in the two months reviewed in this post while I was feeling so physically and mentally ill. Between May and December 2010 I wrote another fourteen.</p>
<p>I crashed down to earth only three days and six thousand unpublished words after my spur-of-the-moment decision to write a fifty-thousand word <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/" title="National Novel Writing Month">NaNoWriMo</a> &rsquo;novel&rsquo; in thirty days. Like all the other novels I&rsquo;ve started, this one remains unfinished, although I did get past page four on this occasion. All of this was while I was working full-time. Mild insomnia helped.</p>
<h2 id="man-flu">Man flu</h2>
<p>Just like in 1994, 1999 and 2004, I felt myself slowly burn out as Xmas approached and by the time #SnowMorrissey had melted I was feeling too depressed to work or do anything else other than go to the doctor&rsquo;s surgery. My GP doubled my anti-depressant dose and I later self-diagnosed the new but familiar sharp stabbing pain in my lower right side under my ribs as pleurisy for which <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/18798199" title="An effective remedy for the pain of pleurisy">I prescribed myself Lemsip Max</a>. The previous year I&rsquo;d had a similar but worse pain with frightening shortness of breath, which only cleared up after a month or so using an inhaler.</p>
<p>Less perceptively and spookily - and admittedly without the benefit of a stethoscope, cheeseometer or any medical training - <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/18801119" title="Diagnosis: Man flu">Andy C was less concerned about my physical health</a>. Less is more.</p>
<p>Six days later, after a brief investigation with her stethoscope, <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/19360849" title="Medical confirmation of pleurisy">my GP confirmed my pleuritic self-diagnosis</a>, signed me off work and prescribed my some antibiotics for a chest infection, too. Unfortunately, she didn&rsquo;t have a cheeseometer either. I started to feel a bit better, but a cold winter&rsquo;s night a week or so on and the pain returned. Perhaps understandably, <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/20072965" title="Feeling miserable">I was generally feeling more and more miserable</a>, too.</p>
<p>At least <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/20121348" title="The breaking loose of all Hell in the workplace">everything was running smoothly at work</a> during my two weeks absence.</p>
<h2 id="its-just-a-slice-of-cheese38">&lsquo;<a href="http://identi.ca/notice/20130772" title="Perceptively and spookily pre-empting my own cheese-fuelled worst nightmare">It&rsquo;s just a slice of cheese</a>&rsquo;</h2>
<p>I went back to work on 1 February <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/20645565" title="Football and mental health">feeling much better</a> after United had made City wait another year at least for their first trophy since 1976 and after setting in motion Arsenal&rsquo;s annual implosion.</p>
<p>Seventeen days and an x-ray later, however, I was in Accident and Emergency with a suspected collapsed right lung. After a blood test to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t suffering from a heart problems I went home the same evening. The following day I <a href="http://identi.ca/conversation/22430772" title="Tory scumbag">developed a strong desire to punch Nicholas Winterton in the face</a>. Repeatedly. And regularly. Say every ten minutes. Coincidence?</p>
<h2 id="pull-yourself-together41"><a href="http://identi.ca/notice/18359321" title="A favourite saying of local psychiatrists">Pull yourself together</a></h2>
<p>By now, I&rsquo;d lost touch with <a href="http://identi.ca/reality" title="Luke Slater on identi.ca">Reality</a>, <a href="http://identi.ca/conversation/22500753" title="Conversation with Luke Slater aka Reality on the medicinal merits of sugar pills">defending homeopathy</a>. I&rsquo;d lost hope, despairing at <a href="http://identi.ca/jrobertson" title="James Robertson on identi.ca">James Robertson</a>&rsquo;s inevitably futile struggles to <a href="http://identi.ca/conversation/20779493#notice-20788418" title="Do not try this at home">print and use his own postage</a> using only Free and open source software. I&rsquo;d lost my humanity, calling Basil Brush impersonator <a href="http://identi.ca/rpcutts" title="Richard Cutts on identi.ca">Richard Cutts</a> a <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/22504487" title="Boom! Boom!">demented glove puppet</a> for agreeing with me about Nicholas Winterton.</p>
<p>Three weeks before my x-ray, I&rsquo;d phoned the local mental health trust to find out what had happened to the referral letter my GP had sent them back in September 2009, four months earlier. They helpfully told me that I wasn&rsquo;t a priority for treatment because I was working and, therefore, apparently OK. I asked them what did I have to do in order to become a priority? Try to kill myself? They offered me an appointment the same afternoon.</p>
<p>Naively, I assumed that this would be an appointment with a psychiatrist. After waiting for an hour behind the locked doors and shatter-proof glass partitions of the Community Mental Health Team building that kept the professional healers and helpers apart from me and rest of the presumably perceived as dangerous local community it serves, it turned out to be an appointment with a nurse who scribbled a few notes on a scrap of paper. He then produced a copy of a letter dated the same day that he claimed had been posted to me the day before inviting me to a meeting with a psychiatrist in two weeks.</p>
<p>Three days before my x-ray, I met the psychiatrist. I made an extra effort to wash my hair, shave and put on clean clothes to make myself look less like Jim Ignatowski.</p>

<p>He sat in front of me reading my notes as if for the first time. After a couple of uncomfortably silent minutes he said &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not <a href="http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/press/pressreleases2010/selfdiagnosingbipolardisorder.aspx" title="I'm not Stephen Fry">Stephen Fry</a> bipolar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I suppose I should have been relieved about that, but my immediate reaction was confusion - how could he possibly know? All he had asked me was &lsquo;Would you like a coffee?&rsquo; He didn&rsquo;t even ask if I wanted decaf, sugar or milk and yet he was magically able to undiagnose me without conducting any blood tests, x-rays, scans or other measurements of the balance of chemicals sloshing around in my brain, which is the current unproven theory of choice among the medically inclined.</p>
<p>We had a bit of a chat. I asked for psychotherapy on the NHS as I could no longer afford to pay privately. He recommended that I keep taking the medication even though I complained to him that I felt worse than ever after four months on them. I was finding sleep difficult, yet felt tired all the time, couldn&rsquo;t concentrate properly, had a dry mouth and sometimes felt my mood change from OK, to tearful, to agitated, to angry and even to suicidal in the space of a few hours.</p>
<p>I told him I&rsquo;d washed and dressed specially for him. He laughed and said that was good, because otherwise he&rsquo;d have had to section me under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health_Act_2007" title="Wikipedia article on the UK's Mental Health Act 2007">Mental Health Act</a> (have me forcibly detained in the mental health unit of the hospital). He rounded off our meeting by suggesting that I should pull myself together and get a life (not his exact words, but my honest interpretation and not far off). As I bid him goodbye and was closing the door to leave he asked me if I had any plans to kill myself.</p>
<p>I decided to stop taking my medication. Within ten days <a href="http://anotherurl.info/why-england-dont-have-a-hope-in-hell-of-winning-the-football-world-cup-in-2010" title="Why England Don't Have A Hope In Hell Of Winning The Football World Cup In 2010">I successfully predicted England&rsquo;s abysmal failure in the South African World Cup</a>.</p>
<p>Look out for more cheesy Twenty Ten goodness next week as I march on into March and explain the cheesy references&hellip;.</p>

Can also leave you feeling tired and miserable for days afterwards if you’re over 40.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Undoubtedly the football fan’s favourite tipple, alcohol can make even France versus Uruguay seem like the most compelling game of end-to-end football you’ve ever seen.

<p>On Another Planet this week: controversial new government plans to tackle ever increasing worklessness using <a href="http://waterboarding.org/how-to" title="Waterboarding how-to guide">waterboarding</a>.</p>
<p>Techniques refined and perfected by secret military personnel known only by their codename &lsquo;Our Boys&rsquo; are being piloted by the NHS in an effort to &rsquo;encourage and empower&rsquo; people claiming statutory sick pay to return to work.</p>
<p>One persistent malingerer, who asked not to be identified, claimed that he was subjected to an horrific ordeal at the hands of his torturers and says he was tricked into believing he was just playing a game of &lsquo;doctors and nurses&rsquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I always liked playing doctors and nurses when I was a kid,&rsquo; said Roger (not his real name).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over to Roger to tell the rest of his story.</p>
<h2 id="nazi">Nazi</h2>
<p>I received a phone call from my local hospital telling me I had an appointment with the chest consultant I&rsquo;d seen before. I thought it was a bit odd, because I&rsquo;d seen the surgeon who operated on me only the previous day, but I went in anyway. I felt I could trust these people after they did such a great job of fixing my lung. Anyway, when I got there, they made me wait for an hour as usual, then a pretty young student doctor asked if I minded if she sat in on my appointment? How could I say no? I could barely speak with my tongue hanging out like that. So I just nodded and wiped the dribble from the side of my mouth hoping she hadn&rsquo;t noticed. When I got to see the consultant himself I thought it was a bit odd that he was wearing full Nazi regalia, but he seemed like a nice guy and to know his stuff.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t rush back to work&quot;, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3GcKnxaR3Go/TirPK8duQ7I/AAAAAAAApns/sB2kCgrxRq0/s800/Mancow-Muller-Waterboarding-276x300.jpg" alt="Bronchoscopy" title="Bronchoscopy simulation"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Now, about this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy" title="Bronchoscopy on Wikipedia">bronchoscopy</a>. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m sure everything will be OK. I&rsquo;m 90% sure everything&rsquo;s fine. People say it tickles a little bit, but you&rsquo;ll have a sedative and some local anaesthetic that they put up your nose and on the back of your throat. That will make you cough, but it&rsquo;s really nothing to worry about.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&lsquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rsquo; I told him.</p>
<hr>
<p>So this week I went in for my &lsquo;bronchoscopy&rsquo;. After waiting the requisite hour, I was hurried into the day surgery operating theatre by a pretty young nurse and ignored by the doctor. Another nurse made small talk with me to reassure me. I clambered on to the operating table so that I was sat upright with my legs outstretched. The second nurse put a bib on me to deal with my dribbling while the doctor chatted with his friend on his mobile.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Dr Heydrich,&rsquo; he said to me finally.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Although I had been feeling relaxed, at this point I suddenly felt a twinge of anxiety.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to put some anaesthetic gel up your nose,&rsquo; he said, as he squirted anaesthetic gel up my nose.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The second nurse then stuffed a tube up my left nostril, saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s only oxygen.&rsquo;</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="banana-splat">Banana splat</h2>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CQ6Qb6vbufI/TirPCvomAvI/AAAAAAAApmI/AUmmoIzu0ks/s800/visor-300x300.jpg" alt="Visor" title="Splatter protection">
I looked at her and she had donned what looked like a welder&rsquo;s visor. &lsquo;You look like you&rsquo;re about to do some welding,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just to protect myself from any splatter,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Another twinge.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;OK, open your mouth, please,&rsquo; barked Heydrich. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to spray some anaesthetic on the back of your throat. It tastes very strongly of bananas,&rsquo; he added, as he sprayed what tasted like banana flavoured liqueur on to the back of my throat, making me cough. &lsquo;Just a little bit more,&rsquo; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&lsquo;UURRRGGHHH!!!&rsquo; I splattered.</p>
<hr>
<p>&lsquo;UURRRGGHHH!!! UURRRGGHHH!!!&rsquo; I repeated.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rsquo; said the second nurse, holding my head down with her hand. &lsquo;It makes you feel like there&rsquo;s a ball in your throat and you can&rsquo;t swallow.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&lsquo;UURRRGGHHH!!! UURRRGGHHH!!!&rsquo; I repeated, desperately.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Heydrich then took what I had thought was a stethoscope and zoomed towards me with the bright flashing end of it and shoved it up my right nostril.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>AARRRGGHHH!!!&quot; I said.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s try the other one,&quot; said Heydrich.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>They swapped the oxygen for the stethoscope, which then dropped out of my traumatised right nostril.</p>
<hr>
<p>&lsquo;AARRRGGHHH!!! AARRRGGHHH!!!&rsquo; I repeated.</p>
<hr>
<p>That hurt even more than the right one did. The second nurse (I don&rsquo;t know what the first nurse was doing, but she was there afterwards) then pushed something into my mouth, saying, &lsquo;Open your mouth and hold it with your teeth.&rsquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Heydrich zoomed back into view.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll try it through the mouth&rsquo;, he said, as he pushed the thick black fibre-optic tube down my throat.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&lsquo;UURRRGGHHH!!! UURRRGGHHH!!!&rsquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>I tried to cough and splutter, but my throat was numb and I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I felt like I was drowning.</p>
<hr>
<p>&lsquo;UURRRGGHHH!!! AARRRGGHHH!!!&rsquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>I panicked and pulled the tube out, gasping for breath.</p>
<hr>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do it!&rsquo; I cried, literally, tears rolling down my cheeks.</p>
<hr>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;ll go back to work. I promise!&rsquo;</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Over. Roger and out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another Planet understands that if this pilot is successful, then the procedure will be rolled out to the rest of the UK in the coming months.</p>
<p>As Nick Clegg-Hess, Deputy Prime Minister, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;What we need is strong, stable government. That means we must weaken and destabilise people who are not working for whatever reason and by any means necessary to get them to conform and work to pay our taxes. This is about control and maintenance of the <em>status quo</em>.

<p>Tags: thoracotomy, empyema, decortication, cheese, collapsed lung, chest infection, pleurisy, NHS,</p>
<p>Last week I met a beautiful young Hispanic woman and we spent the night together. She cared for me deeply and carefully, and I gazed upon her lovingly as the morphine (d)ripped through my veins. She checked me out and made sure that everything seemed to be in working order.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Sofia,&rsquo;  she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to be looking after you tonight.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the morphine, I carried on smiling and Sofia carried on with her job of nursing me through my first night after my thoracotomy on the high dependency unit of the five star NHS hospital I was staying in.</p>
<p>I had quite a good time despite drinking nothing but water the entire evening. We shared a few bottles together - Sofia would hand me an empty one, pull the covers around me and I would half-fill it and hand it back to her so she could measure and record, discard and disinfect. She checked my tubes and drains to make sure they weren&rsquo;t getting clogged up with &lsquo;cheese&rsquo; or any other unwanted dairy products. She made sure that my drains were working properly and that I was getting enough suction (stop it!). In the morning, she washed my back. My only regret is that half-way through the night somebody much more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->attractive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ill than me was trolleyed through and Sofia spent more time with him than she did with me.</p>
<h2 id="a-good-swing">A good swing</h2>
<p>So, Sofia had taken over from Gilbert, a beautiful young Chinese-looking man who I woke up with after my general anaesthetic. Gilbert was every bit as diligent and caring as Sofia and I don&rsquo;t think this is just the drugs talking. I was amazed by the level of care I received throughout my stay, with one or two relatively minor exceptions, which I&rsquo;ll come to later. And it&rsquo;s not just because I was probably quite a good patient - I was calm, polite, not in any great pain or discomfort, doing well - eating, drinking, breathing, coughing and I had a &lsquo;good swing&rsquo;. Most of the other patients around me appeared to be quite a lot older than me and if not older then certainly in more pain or experiencing more problems after their operations. They were cared for with equal if not more time and attention as far as I could see and hear.</p>

<p>Who else do I need to thank for treating me so well? On admission to the hospital at 7 am on Friday morning I was met by nurse Martin, who seemed more nervous than me, but who handed me over to the highly organised Lindsay. Lyndsay wasted no time in getting me half-naked on to the bed so that she could attach clips and cables to my chest and stomach to run an ECG. Then she made me strip completely and wear a flowery dress. To complete my humiliation, she had me walk down to the diagnostic testing department in full public view where I had an x-ray. When I got back she wanted me to wear some thigh-high stockings, too. How could I resist her helping hands to put them on for me? Thank you Lyndsay!</p>
<p>Thanks also to Rick, the porter, for your sense of humour in wheeling me up and down and up and down again to the operating theatre where I&rsquo;m sure everyone had a good laugh at me in drag. No doubt the pictures are all over the internet by now. And thanks to Dorcas, the clinical nurse specialist who spoke to me on the phone before I went in to tell me how bad it was going to be and who greeted me in the hospital before the operation with her hands - literally a nice touch, and one repeated by Lyndsay, Rick, Gilbert and Sofia later. A quick, simple touch to the hand, the shoulder, arm or elbow is extremely reassuring I find. Thanks for your humanity.</p>
<h2 id="the-cheese-factor">The cheese factor</h2>
<p>Pre-operation, I also spoke to several doctors/surgeons/registrars or whatever they call themselves. They may even have had first names, but somehow if they did those names haven&rsquo;t stuck. All I can really remember is being told that the operation would take 90-120 minutes rather than the 30-45 minutes I was expecting. This was due to the fact that they would be doing a conventional &rsquo;large&rsquo; incision of about 10 cm rather than the keyhole 2 cm cuts I&rsquo;d been told I was going to have. The change of <em>modus operandi</em> was because of the &lsquo;cheese&rsquo; factor - they needed to scrape the rind off the lung, not simply drain fluid. I signed the consent form. By this time they had me where they wanted me and I had resigned myself to my fate. What else could I do but submit? Yes, there&rsquo;s a risk with everything, but carrying on with a lung full of cheese didn&rsquo;t seem like a good bet.</p>
<p>Finally, Rick got me into theatre again after an aborted first attempt because my blood results weren&rsquo;t back in time. This also meant a delay of an hour and a half, which didn&rsquo;t affect me too much. I was kind of in a semi-meditational state I reckon. Either that or just frozen with fear. Now it was the turn of the anaesthetists to do things to me. Thanks to Belton (not Ben Elton) for painlessly finding my veins first time and inserting the cannulas that would feed the juice to knock me out and sustain me with fluids. All I can remember is a bit of aimless chit-chat, breathing deeply into the gas mask that was placed over my face and&hellip;.</p>
<h2 id="chris-the-crafty-cockney">Chris the Crafty Cockney</h2>
<p>Less than two hours later I woke up on the high dependency unit with Gilbert looking after me. At some point I remember my surgeon coming round to tell me, quite madly in his Chris the Crafty Cockney way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re fixed!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo; I said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>
<p>After Gilbert and Sofia, I was handed over to Tara, who was a bundle of fun in our short time together. Tara couldn&rsquo;t wait to get rid of me, though, and pushed the wheelchair herself to get me on to the main ward so that she could go and have lunch or something. I had been looking forward to moving wards actually. The high dependency unit was a bit noisy and a bit dull and now I would have access to my belongings that I brought with me - mp3/video player, internet, email, phone, etc. But when I was shown to my room (it&rsquo;s on old private hospital bought by the NHS) I felt strangely disheartened and lonely. On the high dependency unit, Gilbert, Sofia and Tara were always within eyesight or earshot, but on the ward my new nurse Nas and everyone else was gone within seconds. I was still attached to two drains and my morphine drip, so I couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere. I felt as helpless as a baby.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7QZGvto9lSM/TirPQVlAtTI/AAAAAAAApo8/9Rhu8xWbfA8/s400/CIMG1240-600x450.jpg" alt="Rhubarb and custard, or, cold wet cardboard and yellow slop" title="Rhubarb and custard, or, cold wet cardboard and yellow slop"></p>
<p>At least I was on the ward in time for the Manchester derby, the most important game since the last one. And my mum and step-dad John were visiting at 2pm. Lunch was forgettable - one of my few complaints is that the food was largely very poor quality. As I discovered on my discharge from the hospital, there is a very good coffee bar and staff/visitors&rsquo; restaurant in the hospital, which I believe is managed by the same company that provides the patients&rsquo; meals, yet the comparison is dreadful. I didn&rsquo;t have much of an appetite due to the morphine, but it doesn&rsquo;t help when you are served up slop that is worse than school meals of thirty-odd years ago.</p>
<p>Back to the footy. My mum proudly explained that my brother would be texting her with news of any goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s great, Mum. But I&rsquo;m getting text updates from the BBC every few minutes on my internet tablet.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BBC text updates on one of the most uneventful ninety minutes in the history of football aren&rsquo;t much fun, but sustained conversation more than my brother&rsquo;s updates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BLEEP!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crikey, a text from my brother to my mother.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;15 seconds left. Scholes header. Game over.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My mum read the text out loud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;What does that mean?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, christ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;It means,&rsquo; explained ever-patient John, who is not a football fan:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;United have won the game with a last minute winner yet again.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Oh.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think it means?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This remote victory barely raised a smile on my dry lips and hardly registered an increased pulse according to Nas when she took my blood pressure. It is surely my least celebrated United goal ever, although I did manage a laugh and a cheer the next morning watching the highlight on Match of the Day.</p>

<p>Sunday I had three separate visitors morning, afternoon and evening and I suspect I was fairly grumpy/tired during at least one of those, so apologies certainly to my dad. I have to say, though, that visits are extremely tiring and quite emotional. It&rsquo;s no wonder hospitals advise no more than two visitors at a time. And when you&rsquo;re in that state of post-op pain or discomfort, lack of mobility, tiredness, feeling sick etc., you&rsquo;re really not much company. It&rsquo;s great to see people, of course, but as a visitor you can&rsquo;t expect too much from your relative or friend. And thanks, dad, for leaving me with the advice to get a hair cut and a shave so that I don&rsquo;t look so much like Frank Gallagher!</p>
<p>A quick thanks also at this point to some more lovely nurses - Sarah, Yvonne, Nadia, Esther - sorry if I missed anyone.</p>
<h2 id="minor-complaints">Minor complaints</h2>
<p>I mentioned earlier a couple of minor exceptions to the high level of care I received while in hospital.</p>
<p>One would be that the cannula on my wrist became loose, swollen red and painful. I asked one of the nurses about it and she said it was ok and bandaged it up (after dropping the bandage on the floor!) to hold it in place. Later another nurse came to use the cannula to inject my antibiotics. Now this can usually feel a little uncomfortable, but nothing more than that. This time I was screaming in agony. I pointed out the problem again and she said that it was &lsquo;unacceptable&rsquo;, removed the cannula, patched me up and fixed the cannula in my hand so that it could be used for both the morphine drip and the antibiotics, painlessly.</p>
<p>My second minor complaint would be that the same nurse who dropped the bandage came in gloved-up to remove my second drain, then went out again touching the door handle to call for assistance (two nurses are required - one to pull the drain out, one to tie the stitch, the painful bit). I asked her to change her gloves, which she did so willingly and acknowledging that she should do so. The point is that she should be taking the initiative not waiting for patients to prompt her. It&rsquo;s fairly basic stuff.</p>
<p>My only other quibble is that I was discharged on Tuesday morning (four days after my op), barely able to walk more than a few yards without getting out of breath so basically forced to book a taxi home. They gave me some paracetamol, ibuprofen and dihydrocodeine for the pain, but for three out of the five days I&rsquo;ve been home so far that hasn&rsquo;t been enough to control the pain. It&rsquo;s really been quite distressing for me and for my family to see me in so much pain and to be able to do nothing to help. I&rsquo;m seeing my GP on Monday so maybe I&rsquo;ll get some extra help with that.</p>
<h2 id="the-drugs-didnt-work">The drugs didn&rsquo;t work</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how long it&rsquo;s going to take for me to recover and go back to working full-time. As far as I know, I&rsquo;m expected to make a full recovery, although I was a more than a little perturbed to read that post-op pain from a thoracotomy can take months or even years to go away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure how this all happened. In January I had a chest infection and pleuritic pain similar to that which I&rsquo;d had in March 2009 when I had a really acute episode of shortness of breath, fever and a consolidation on the same lung. That cleared up quickly with antibiotics and an inhaler. This time around, the drugs didn&rsquo;t work, so my body responded by sealing off the infection in my lung by surrounding the lung with fluid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I tried to work through this in February, which left me feeling too exhausted to go get an x-ray right away. Once I got the x-ray I was admitted to Accident and Emergency immediately where they did some tests to rule out heart problems, I think, before sending me home. Then I had to wait five weeks before seeing a chest specialist and another week or two before getting the results of fluid samples and a CT scan.</p>
<h2 id="hard-cheese">Hard cheese</h2>
<p>As luck would have it, all of these tests were negative (ruling out the likes of cancer and smoking as possible causes, as far as I know). But the build up of fluid had continued and I had progressively felt more and more physically and mentally tired. My surgeon was certain that I had what is known as empyema (the hard &lsquo;cheese&rsquo; as he called it and that I talked about earlier) and this required decortication (scraping the rind off the lung) via a thoracotomy (an incision along the underside of the shoulder blade).</p>
<p>As it turned out, I was told that the scraping bit wasn&rsquo;t required, which is great news as that would likely have damaged the tissues of the lung. I&rsquo;ll be seeing my surgeon again in a week or two I think and the chest specialist next month. I&rsquo;ve been told it&rsquo;s still possible that I could have tuberculosis, although there is no evidence of that yet (it takes a while to show up apparently). Meanwhile I&rsquo;m taking antibiotics for pneumonia - if I don&rsquo;t breathe deeply and cough well enough I&rsquo;m at risk of getting a chest infection. And, despite the lovely nurses, I don&rsquo;t want to go there again!</p>

			 <p>The only United match I’ve been to in recent years was last season’s FA Cup tie at home to Spurs, courtesy of E.on’s sponsorship and their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Family Football<!-- raw HTML omitted --> initiative. I went with a couple of my ‘clients’ from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->work<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, had a great road trip and fantastic all-round experience. One’s a Spurs fan, and I know he felt a mixture of joy and anxiety sat in amongst all the United fans (even in the Family stand) when Spurs went 1-0 up. But both were amazed by the genuine friendliness and good-natured humour of the locals as we mingled around outside the stadium before kick-off. I’m pleased to say that both are working or about to start work now. I really believe that going to this match (and we also went to Wembley and White Hart Lane) helped to put a bit of the spark back into their lives, to begin to believe and to hope again. The Theatre of Dreams, indeed!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I went to a few games in the ’90s when I was working in Manchester, mostly European nights, which then weren’t that well supported. I remember seeing David Beckham play one of his first games and you could see right away that he was a special talent. Before that, I saw Roy Keane when he was still at Forest. I think he scored a hat-trick at Bolton (where I was studying) and he was another one that you could see was on another level, right away. My favourite game in the 90’s, though, has to be Sheffield United away in a midweek game. We won 3-0, fabulous counter-attacking stuff and fantastic goals from Cantona, Hughes and Sharpe!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back to the late 70’s again, my dad took me to see United get walloped 4-0 at OT by Cloughie’s Forest and I saw the 3-5 thrashing we received at the hands of West Brom, not to mention the 0-0 versus Wolves with George Berry. We were frigging crap a lot of the time, occasionally brilliant, but never consistently good enough.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have a lot to thank my dad for. Thanks, Dad! He got me a Subbuteo set one Xmas and meticulously painted on the United colours, numbers and even facial hair of the players. I was gutted when my ickle Lou Macari broke both legs and he was never the same player again despite being able to return for the next match thanks to a tube of superglue!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The best thing about all of this, though, is being able to immediately rebut all the ABUs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who, when I tell them who I support, start their tired old accusations of glory-hunting, London Reds, etc. I started watching United when they were at their lowest ebb (in terms of league status) since they became popular worldwide. I’ve personally endured almost twenty of the “years of hurt” growing up watching those other reds (funny how so many of the kids I went to school with in Lincolnshire were Liverpool fans) win year after year with just a few crumbs of comfort coming our way in the FA Cup. Both my mum and dad were and still are ardent United supporters and if it wasn’t for them I’d probably be a Mariner or worse!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, thanks, mum and dad, for uniting and ensuring that I was born in Stretford General!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fans of ‘Anyone but United’. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->↩<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>It’s often the case that what in one sense is an undeniable strength can at the same time also be a real or potential weakness. English football’s great history and tradition raises everyone’s expectations, yet the English football team must compete on an increasingly commercialised and sophisticated international playing field. We have more fans, more money and more foreigners in our game than any other country, so it’s no surprise that when things don’t go to plan, everyone feels quite upset and let down. And the media does its best to blame anyone and everyone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There’s such a lot at stake, now. It was only sixty years or so ago that the Football Association, which is now grieving over the financial loss of failure to qualify for Euro 2008 and stating that qualification for Euro and World Cup Finals is a minimum requirement of the team manager/coach, actively prevented the national team from taking part. It’s only forty years or so since we won it. As it happens, Sir Alf Ramsey, like Second Choice Steve McClaren also failed to qualify for his first Euro Finals in 1964…. We have a long history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world, so it’s not as if it’s anything new or that we should be surprised about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with English football has been documented in the press as being anything from too many foreign players, too much money, expectation of fans not matched with reality, players and coaches not good enough, not enough passion or care, too much passion and not enough technique, too much pressure and fear, too much drinking and not enough team spirit. The reality is probably that all of these factors are important to a lesser or greater degree. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too many foreign players<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Sven-Goran Erikkson points out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, managers often buy overseas players because they are cheaper on average than their English or British counterparts. That’s also why so few of our players play abroad - because there isn’t the money to pay them, not necessarily that they aren’t good enough. Beckham was and arguably still is good enough to play for Real Madrid. That’s why there are too many foreign players.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much money<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So part of the problem may be that the players get paid too much? But that is not the players’ fault, just market forces, mainly to do with Sky TV money and, er, the FA, who contract with them for Premier League (the same FA which hijacked the Football League) and England rights. What this means is that the very best English players - who are on a par at least, with the very best players in the world - are paid significantly more. This is why Arsene Wenger has so few English players in his squad, not because they aren’t good enough, but because they are too expensive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The new Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe I’m wrong, but it seems to me that we are repeating what happened in Scotland during the Graeme Souness era at Rangers - he bought lots of foreigners in, Celtic and others later followed suit and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Scottish national team suffered as a result<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’m not the only one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who thinks that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->England are the new Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The recent Scottish revival has surely been due to Rangers and Celtic developing a core group of home-grown players to complement their foreign signings. And I’m sure that a lot of their England based players can’t wait to get a game for Scotland after watching too many games from the stand or playing for less successful clubs!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overpaid English players<!-- raw HTML omitted -->At club level, Arsenal are successful in part at least because they have a salary structure which prevents them buying overpaid English players, but keeps team spirit up - see how much better they are doing without the overpaid Henry! Same with United to a different extent. Fergie’s discipline is what he buys by paying top wages and Ince, Kanchelskis, Beckham, Van Nistelrooy and Keane are all examples of players who reached their sell-by dates, for the team’s eventual benefit. Chelsea pay everyone top wages, of course, while my guess is that the likes of Liverpool, Newcastle, Spurs and any other under-achievers get the balance wrong between wages and value.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much pressure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there’s more to it than that. Michael Owen says that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the players can’t cope with the pressure of playing for England now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not that they don’t care. Although at some point we have to admit that other teams are sometimes better than us, that would certainly explain some lacklustre performances and results. Where does the pressure come from? The fans? The media?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My opinion is that the fans want England to win, or - if they can’t win - to play well, trying. The media just want to sell stories, and their marketing strategy is the time-honoured sensationalism of even the most mundane non-news (Steve McClaren under an umbrella. OK, so he looked a bit daft, but, if he kept dry and we’d won…). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we lost to Croatia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What we should all have been saying was congratulations to Croatia on a deserved victory and let’s support McClaren in  rebuilding for real this time instead of picking on every little thing and waiting for him to fail. Things looked good against Russia and Israel, he stumbled across a “system” (Gerrard and Barry) that worked. He was unlucky with injuries, but should have been given longer.</p>

			 <p>United’s FA Cup tie with Wolves last weekend and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Auntie’s ‘flashback’<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Rio Ferdinand?), reminded me to finally get around to posting a few of my own memories, originally prompted by George Best’s sad demise in November.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->George had quit United long before I can first remember watching them. But Best remained an important part of my United life - the school chant was “Georgie Best, Superstar, He walks like a woman and he wears a bra!” - and Dad would always remind me that whatever “my” United did they were never as good as Best, Law an Charlton and the rest of Busby’s Babes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can see what he meant, now! And he did concede that watching Cantona, Kanchelskis and Giggs at their peak was probably just as exciting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, 1974-5 season was my first, when United were in the old League Division Two. I didn’t understand the significance of the different divisions then, just enjoyed the BBC’s and Yorkshire TV’s occasional match coverage when we took on the regional challengers of the time - the big guns of York City, Rotherham United, Hull City and Sheffield Wednesday, if my memory serves me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That year we won the D2 title and returned to the top division.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We then got to three out of the next four Cup Finals (when that meant something), winning just once (but against Treble-chasing Liverpool).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six years after we had won the European Cup with Best, Law, Charlton and the rest we had teams comprising (as I remember them):<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Alex Stepney, then Paddy Roche, then Gary Bailey <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2 Alex Forsyth, then Jimmy Nichol <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 Stuart Houston, then Arthur Albiston (who popped up on Five Live recently) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 Gerry Daly, then Brian Greenhof, then Sammy McIlroy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 Brian Greenhoff, then Gordon McQueen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 Martin Buchan (c) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 Steve Coppell <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8 Sammy McIlroy, then Jimmy Greenhoff <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9 Stuart Pearson, then Joe Jordan <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 Lou Macari <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11 Gordon Hill, then Mickey Thomas <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 David McCreery, then Ashley Grimes<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stepney was a legend, the last of Sir Matt’s European Champions. Bailey was talented - I remember a couple of full-stretch diving saves he made in the 5-3 home defeat by West Brom….Houston was the first person I’d ever heard tell someone else to fuck off. That he did it in response to baiting from a total stranger on the terraces was even more startling to me then.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ever since I always had a sense that Houston was quite evil. I’m sure he isn’t! It reminds me, too, of the televised live England game when Ray Wilkins told the (Uruguyan?) ball boy to “give me the fucking ball”. Not to mention when Eric jumped into the crowd feet first!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->McIlroy was ‘the last of the Busby Babes’ (probably also ‘the new George Best’), but never quite managed to live up to it, despite being a great servant to the club. I was really sad when he had to leave not long after Bryan Robson and Remi Moses arrived a few years later. Not long before he moved on he scored a fantastic solo goal against Wolves.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Buchan was the ever-dependable rock and heartbeat of the team.

Probably would make a good manager one day…. Career cut short by injury.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pearson was an up-and-at-them, no fear, old-fashioned centre forward, replaced by Joe Jordan, an up-and-at-them, no fear, old-fashioned centre forward with no front teeth. Wonderful!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Macari was the mischief-maker-in-chief, apparently ran a chip shop outside the ground and provided the role model for free-scoring (Celtic) strikers to sign for United, dry up and move back into midfield….<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gordon Hill’s demise was a source of childhood grief for me, which even now I find difficult to understand. Lee Sharpe followed suit more recently. Thomas was a cheeky-chappy, work-hard, play-hard type with silly hair.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->McCreery was our not-so-supersub and Grimes was never a United player, surely?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Which brings me back to the current team/squad. Who are the Ashley Grimeses of today? Van der Sar looks a bit like Paddy Roche, but so did Roy Carroll. We need a world class keeper, still.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gary Neville will be looking forward to the Liverpool rematch in the Cup, no doubt!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wes Brown might still come through as genuine class, but realistically he’s always going to be a squaddie. Same applies to Mikael Silvestre.

That’s probably the wrong question. Football’s a team game and the best teams don’t rely on one player, but on individuals gelling as units within the team.

			 <p>I guess one reason I&rsquo;m able to maintain my weight is all the healthy eating I&rsquo;ve been doing lately. So I thought I&rsquo;d share with the one or two people who come here some of my culinary creations. Who knows where it will lead?</p>
<p>For Valentine&rsquo;s Day I came up with the original and undoubtedly passionate meal idea of&hellip; sausages. Really it&rsquo;s a sausage casserole (I looked at the back of a packet of Colman&rsquo;s casserole mix in Tesco for the ingredients and just left out the cancer-causing stuff - not that I&rsquo;m feeling superior in any way as I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve eaten plenty of it in the past), but I like to call it:</p>
<h2 id="bangers-n-mash">Bangers &rsquo;n&rsquo; Mash:</h2>
<ul>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>chilli oil</li>
<li>garlic paste</li>
<li>herbs and spices: dried sage, parsley, oregano, - paprika, black pepper, sea salt</li>
<li>baby onions</li>
<li>green pepper</li>
<li>mushrooms</li>
<li>tinned, chopped plum tomatoes</li>
<li>instant onion gravy</li>
<li>tomato ketchup</li>
<li>cooked Lincolnshire sausages</li>
<li>potatoes</li>
<li>butter</li>
<li>milk</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a nice way to use up some leftover sausages - you don&rsquo;t have to use Lincolnshire sausages, any will do, same with most of the ingredients. I just use what&rsquo;s available to me. This will make enough for four servings.</p>
<p>Get a large pan for your peeled and, washed and finely chopped potatoes, adding a drop of olive oil and some sea salt and covering with water. Put it on a high heat until it comes to the boil, then simmer for fifteen to twenty minutes or until the potatoes are soft enough to mash easily.</p>
<p>Assuming you have some pre-cooked sausages and you&rsquo;ve prepared all the veg, heat up your wok or large frying pan, add a good shake of olive oil, chilli oil to suit your taste and a little butter to stop the oil from burning. When it&rsquo;s hot, add a teaspoon of garlic paste, a shake of the herbs and spices followed quickly by the onions, peppers and mushrooms and stir-fry on a high heat for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The longer you do it, the softer and smaller the peppers and mushrooms will be, so do it as you like it. Add the tomatoes, make up half a pint of instant onion gravy and stir it in. Add a teaspoon of ketchup (or use lemon juice, vinegar and sugar) and the pre-cooked sausages.</p>
<p>Leave to simmer for at least twenty minutes. When the potatoes are ready, drain and mash with a dollop of butter and a little milk.</p>
<p>Serve.</p>
<p>Like most foods, it will taste even better the following night re-heated.</p>

			 <p>I am rapt. Tight and warm in my sleeping bag, I stare out at the night sky. It is perfectly clear. My fellow hikers are nearby, and in the distance we can hear the sound of coyotes. They are neither barking nor howling, but something between the two, as if they are calling to one another. Their calls become louder.</p>
<p>In the corner of my eye I can see our food, in white plastic bags, hanging from a tree. The coyotes are running, beating a path towards us. My heart races and pounds, with excitement and apprehension, and the effects of ascending so quickly to nine thousand feet. My head aches and I feel sick. Tomorrow, we go higher.</p>
<p>The conifers which shelter us are twenty feet tall. Their tops dance in the wind against a backdrop of stars on a moonlit stage. There goes a shooting star! It is too much. My head spins.</p>
<p>Sleep is not easy. There is a low rumbling, like distant thunder. Then, as if the whole mountain is collapsing, a gust of wind sweeps through the trees, passing us by. It sounds like a train. The gusts become stronger and more frequent; and we are lying on the tracks of the main line. This is a ghost train! The trees bend while I lie rigid, waiting for the crash.</p>
<p>I rise with the sun.</p>
<p>The hike up, the next day, is long and arduous in driving winds. &ldquo;Wail winds wail/ All along, along, along/ The Colorado Trail&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Colorado Trail&rdquo; lines 5-8). The wisps of cloud in the morning sky have become huge and dark. Powdery snow swirls around us, then bites into our faces, as we struggle with freezing hands to set up the tents. The slightest effort saps all our strength and leaves us gasping for air. This, in turn, increases our loss of water with sweat and exhalation.</p>
<p>Once inside, we attempt to melt snow for drinking and cooking food: It takes about two hours to produce one litre. (We had estimated that each person&ndash;four in all&ndash;needed four litres per day. Even with two stoves, it would be impossible.)</p>
<p>I have no appetite, but manage to eat something. My legs and feet are cold.</p>
<p>We try to get some sleep. Although it is warm in our bags, the fierce wind outside makes it impossible. My throat, mouth and lips are dry while the insides of the tent are wet with condensation; as this freezes, it is spat back into our faces by the slapping canvas which seems about to be hoisted away from us at any moment.</p>
<p>The night is endless. I am waiting for a train to take me out of here, but I know they will not stop to pick up passengers. They are expresses, and their speed is urgent. They are delivering the news: And the news is History. We will not climb the peak. We will go down.</p>

			 <p>Mark Twain once informed a preacher visiting Hartford that every word of a sermon the latter had just delivered was in a book at Twain&rsquo;s home. Concerned about the apparent plagiarism, the preacher was only too grateful to receive the book in a parcel at his hotel. It was a dictionary (Wister ziii).</p>
<p>As one of Twain&rsquo;s characters, Huckleberry Finn, said of his creator, he told the truth, mainly (Twain 441). Twain&rsquo;s practical joke could be thought of as a compliment. The preacher expressed his thoughts in a symbolic code which Twain and others could comprehend; by sharing a common language they were able to share ideas.</p>
<p>Although words are defined objectively, often their use is subjective. People learn language not from dictionary definitions, but from their experience of situations in which it is used. Generally, the words first learnt by a child are nouns describing concrete objects (the meaning of the word is obvious). The understanding of abstractions is more difficult, and, perhaps because of this, its value is emphasized in Western culture. In other societies, it may be of greater importance correctly to describe a feature of the environment. Similarly, a person-oriented approach may be more civilized than one that is materialistic.</p>
<p>Just as cultural values differ, so do languages. But, whereas languages can be translated into other tongues, values remain unaltered. It could be argued, therefore, that true translation is impossible; at best, authenticity is compromised. Ideally, it seems, a language is needed which is common to all.</p>
<p>The modern reality, of different ethnic groups within one society (but speaking different languages and living separate lives), is a problem not only of intolerance, but also of ignorance. It is not enough simply to be aware of differences. They must be understood in terms of the beliefs they represent. This can be achieved only through experience, preferably personal, of that way of life, and its language from which it is inseparable.</p>
<p>That it is the speakers of minority languages who must learn the language of the majority is a matter of practicality. That they should suffer educationally or socially in relation to their peers is due to cultural biases against them, the effects of which often are compounded by financial poverty. But if such minorities were to decide to opt out they would surely become the objects of greater hostility than that which they already face; the difference from the norm which they represent is proportional to the fear and hatred they induce in others. Alternatively, intregration with the mainstream would further dilute their tradition.</p>
<p>It is possible, and it is certainly necessary, to live in a multi-cultural society. But as the differences become greater so do the problems that come with them. In choosing between separation and homogeneity of cultures, people usually do not have the advantage that Huck Finn has: Faced with the prospect of adoption and &ldquo;sivilization&rdquo; by Aunt Sally, Huck knows that he must move on, he can&rsquo;t stand it. But then, he&rsquo;s been there before (Twain 650).</p>

			 <p>A mass twiddling of thumbs and looking at the ceiling prompted me: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Big,&rdquo; I said. They laughed.</p>
<p>Little did they know.</p>
<p>All were there, as I was, to find out more about exchange programmes to America. The speaker, Rick, was an American from student services. Rick wanted to know what were our preconceptions of his country? I told him.</p>
<p>Impressions gained from film, television and literature ensured I was right about the houses, the cars and the roads. But to me, then and now, Big describes attitudes, personalities and lifestyles; the vastness of the American landscape is matched only by the number and diversity of cultures within its population.</p>
<p>Despite this variation, the stereotypical American who emerges is white, middle-class and male, much like his English counterpart. As a member of a minority group (an Englishman in America), I know how frustrating it is to be denied my regional dialect and prejudices (which now are mostly redundant) in favour of simpler English ones. But being English does have its benefits&ndash;it&rsquo;s cool, awesome, and, &ldquo;I love that accent, say G&rsquo;day mate for me.&rdquo; That I can be mistaken for an Australian might be explained by the American educational priority given to quantity of knowledge, as opposed to its quality&ndash;they know that I am foreign, but not from which hemisphere I come&ndash;but more likely by the success of Paul Hogan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crocodile Dundee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A similar set of values seems to determine television standards, although some shows are so bad they require compulsive viewing: Examples are breakfast time chat with local serial-killers, and the macho violence of American Gladiators. American comedy, however, has always been intelligently written (Taxi, Cheers, Moonlighting and Cosby), in spite of some of its moralizing content. English comedy is appreciated, albeit somewhat indiscriminately; Benny Hill is not the same thing as Monty Python.</p>
<p>National character undoubtedly is shaped by a country&rsquo;s history and environment. America&rsquo;s history, compared with England&rsquo;s, is short. While the two countries have experienced both hardship and prosperity, the continued arrival of immigrants has maintained Americans&rsquo; sense of hope for the future, and the unrelenting effects of nature have created a need for organization (with which Americans now seem obsessed). By contrast, the stability of the English way of life has led to cynicism: Nothing will change. People are content, perhaps too much so, to muddle through their lives.</p>
<p>Coming to America has helped me to see both countries in more favourable lights. When the time comes, I will be sorry to leave, but glad to be going home.</p>
