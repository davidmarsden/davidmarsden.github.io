First Man REDACTED, and First REDACTED Eve, lost their innocence and became ashamed of their nakedness. Their sinful obsession with REDACTED made them the world&rsquo;s first REDACTEDs.</p>\n<p>Led by judge, jury and executioner in-chief First Man REDACTED, the REDACTEDers had decided that REDACTED Rotten&rsquo;s use six months previously of &ldquo;REDACTED&rdquo; was non-binary and cast-iron proof that REDACTED is, in fact, REDACTEDphobic, and that cannot be tolerated - or at least, it cannot be tolerated six months down the line when First Man REDACTED, who wasn&rsquo;t cyberstalking REDACTED Rotten at all, just happened to notice that REDACTED had paid for a subscription to REDACTED&rsquo;s newly unelected REDACTEDist henchman REDACTED&rsquo;s REDACTED.com.</p>\n<p>Not only was he a fully paid up member of the REDACTED billionaire&rsquo;s despised social network, REDACTED had publicly praised REDACTED&rsquo;s REDACTED exploration ambitions and his REDACTED cars!</p>\n<p>As if this wasn&rsquo;t REDACTED enough on its own, REDACTED was named as a REDACTED of the REDACTED indieweb REDACTED social network REDACTED, set up several years ago as a community-minded alternative to the toxic REDACTED by the ever so manly monikered REDACTED.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;HOW COULD MANLY MONIKERED REDACTED EMPLOY REDACTED-LOVING REDACTEDPHOBE REDACTED ROTTEN?!!!!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;MANLY MONIKERED REDACTED MUST IMMEDIATELY &ldquo;PRONOUNCE&rdquo; HIS PERSONAL ALLYSHIP WITH TEH REDACTED COMMUNITAH!!1!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;REDACTED MY AUTHORITAH!!1!&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 id=\"fafo1\">FAFO!!1!</h2>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I think REDACTED could and should be more careful with his REDACTED utterances, particularly in his role as a REDACTED of his own REDACTED, which I presume he welcomes anyone and everyone to use, contribute to and subscribe to. It does look bad that he&rsquo;s also a REDACTED REDACTED, and paying REDACTED to use REDACTED, AND praising REDACTED (especially in light of REDACTED&rsquo;s overt REDACTED salutes).</p>\n<p>But in my humble, unwanted and irrelevant white middle-REDACTED male REDACTED-gendered opinion, none of that defines him as a REDACTED-lover or a REDACTEDphobe. I mean, he could be both, or one or the other, or neither. I don&rsquo;t know. I think it&rsquo;s disingenuous to pretend otherwise.</p>\n<p>That said, it doesn&rsquo;t mean people can&rsquo;t be offended by any or all of it six months ago, two weeks ago, now and forever more. In REDACTED&rsquo;s defence, it seems like he did make some kind of apology at the time even if it wasn&rsquo;t good enough, and it was compounded by his publishing of later REDACTED posts complaining about being &lsquo;REDACTED&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>REDACTED, a REDACTED REDACTED who did take offence at REDACTED&rsquo;s &ldquo;REDACTED&rdquo; comment REDACTED her subscription to REDACTED&rsquo;s REDACTED service, and REDACTED about her REDACTED. REDACTED REDACTED her in full, and while it shouldn&rsquo;t have REDACTED, could have been REDACTED much better, and undoubtedly left a very REDACTED REDACTED in the mouth for REDACTED, First Man REDACTED and plenty of others, that really should have been the end of it.</p>\n<p>As others have REDACTED better than me, it does appear as if First Man REDACTED had it in for REDACTED and saw REDACTED&rsquo;s blue REDACTED account and his praise of REDACTED as an opportunity to exert some kind of REDACTED or &ldquo;REDACTED&rdquo; upon him. While I&rsquo;m not suggesting REDACTED set out to invoke the REDACTED REDACTED, he knows as well as anyone what it&rsquo;s all about and The Power To REDACTED get involved in other people&rsquo;s battles.</p>\n<p>So it&rsquo;s somewhat ironic, if no less unpleasant, that in seeking to give up his Power to REDACTED in order to REDACTED the internet, he has now had to REDACTED his REDACTED REDACTED in the face of REDACTED REDACTED.</p>\n",

Their sinful obsession with REDACTED made them the world's first REDACTEDs.\n\nLed by judge, jury and executioner in-chief First Man REDACTED, the REDACTEDers had decided that REDACTED Rotten's use six months previously of \"REDACTED\" was non-binary and cast-iron proof that REDACTED is, in fact, REDACTEDphobic, and that cannot be tolerated - or at least, it cannot be tolerated six months down the line when First Man REDACTED, who wasn't cyberstalking REDACTED Rotten at all, just happened to notice that REDACTED had paid for a subscription to REDACTED's newly unelected REDACTEDist henchman REDACTED's REDACTED.com. \n\nNot only was he a fully paid up member of the REDACTED billionaire's despised social network, REDACTED had publicly praised REDACTED's REDACTED exploration ambitions and his REDACTED cars! \n\nAs if this wasn't REDACTED enough on its own, REDACTED was named as a REDACTED of the REDACTED indieweb REDACTED social network REDACTED, set up several years ago as a community-minded alternative to the toxic REDACTED by the ever so manly monikered REDACTED.\n\n\"HOW COULD MANLY MONIKERED REDACTED EMPLOY REDACTED-LOVING REDACTEDPHOBE REDACTED ROTTEN?!!!!\"\n\n\"MANLY MONIKERED REDACTED MUST IMMEDIATELY \"PRONOUNCE\" HIS PERSONAL ALLYSHIP WITH TEH REDACTED COMMUNITAH!!1!\"\n\n\"REDACTED MY AUTHORITAH!!1!\"\n\n## FAFO!!1!\n\nDon't get me wrong. I think REDACTED could and should be more careful with his REDACTED utterances, particularly in his role as a REDACTED of his own REDACTED, which I presume he welcomes anyone and everyone to use, contribute to and subscribe to. It does look bad that he's also a REDACTED REDACTED, and paying REDACTED to use REDACTED, AND praising REDACTED (especially in light of REDACTED's overt REDACTED salutes). \n\nBut in my humble, unwanted and irrelevant white middle-REDACTED male REDACTED-gendered opinion, none of that defines him as a REDACTED-lover or a REDACTEDphobe. I mean, he could be both, or one or the other, or neither. I don't know. I think it's disingenuous to pretend otherwise.\n\nThat said, it doesn't mean people can't be offended by any or all of it six months ago, two weeks ago, now and forever more. In REDACTED's defence, it seems like he did make some kind of apology at the time even if it wasn't good enough, and it was compounded by his publishing of later REDACTED posts complaining about being 'REDACTED'.\n\nREDACTED, a REDACTED REDACTED who did take offence at REDACTED's \"REDACTED\" comment REDACTED her subscription to REDACTED's REDACTED service, and REDACTED about her REDACTED. REDACTED REDACTED her in full, and while it shouldn't have REDACTED, could have been REDACTED much better, and undoubtedly left a very REDACTED REDACTED in the mouth for REDACTED, First Man REDACTED and plenty of others, that really should have been the end of it.\n\nAs others have REDACTED better than me, it does appear as if First Man REDACTED had it in for REDACTED and saw REDACTED's blue REDACTED account and his praise of REDACTED as an opportunity to exert some kind of REDACTED or \"REDACTED\" upon him. While I'm not suggesting REDACTED set out to invoke the REDACTED REDACTED, he knows as well as anyone what it's all about and The Power To REDACTED get involved in other people's battles.\n\nSo it's somewhat ironic, if no less unpleasant, that in seeking to give up his Power to REDACTED in order to REDACTED the internet, he has now had to REDACTED his REDACTED REDACTED in the face of REDACTED REDACTED.\n",

That's the beauty of it.\n\n>No more gasping for a breath  \n>The air has filled me head-to-toe  \n>And I can see the ground far below  \n>I have this breath and I hold it tight  \n>And I keep it in my chest with all my might  \n>I pray to god this breath will last \n",

Obviously I&rsquo;m about thirteen years after everyone else, as it first aired in 2011. At that time, I was busy singing songs about <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2011/07/19/theres-only-one.html\">one J Carter</a>&hellip;.</p>\n<p><em>Person of Interest</em> is a post 9/11 surveillance thriller, although I still think my initial impression of the first episode - <em>Minority Report</em> meets <em>Police Squad!</em> wasn&rsquo;t far off. After watching two and a half seasons, I&rsquo;d add a good old dollop of <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> into the mix.</p>\n<p>Luckily for me, the whole five seasons was free to watch on Amazon Prime, with just a thirty second ad break halfway through each episode.</p>\n<p>The basic premise for the show is that we are surrounded by cameras recording our every move. The US government wanted to create an automatic means of harnessing all this information for the greater good - preventing terror attacks on its territory.</p>\n<p>The creator of this artificial intelligence - known as <em>The Machine</em> - now has sole access to it. And he is using it to prevent not just terror attacks, but also everyday attacks on ordinary people. People who the government were never interested in because they were irrelevant to national security.</p>\n<p>Finch, who is obviously the brains of the operation, hires some brawn - Reese - to do the dangerous work of physically intervening to prevent daily murders. In fact, Finch rescues Reese from whisky-fuelled vagrancy after his former life as a CIA special agent has fallen apart, and offers him redemption. He&rsquo;s still a hired hitman, but he doesn&rsquo;t have to kill anyone anymore, just save them from murder.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/19/people-dont-change.html\">People don&rsquo;t change, but they can make good decisions</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Luckily there&rsquo;s only one murder a day, and Reese is just as capable sloshed, slashed, shot, and tied up. He&rsquo;s the human embodiment of <em>The Machine</em> - <em>Superman</em>, infallible, with all the (ir)relevant information fed to him by Finch via an earpiece and every conceivable weapon, perfect timing and lucky escape available to him, along with miraculous recovery from injury.</p>\n<p>Between them, they are all-seeing, all-knowing, and omnipresent, and the recipient of mysterious cryptic phone calls revealing the social security number of the next murder victim or perpetrator.</p>\n<p>Soon we start meeting new regular characters. The would-be mob boss working undercover as a shy, socially conscious high school teacher in the toughest area in town. The police homicide detective (one J Carter) looking for &ldquo;The man in the suit&rdquo; - Reese - who keeps being seen at the scene of the incredible deaths of various villains. The corrupt police officers (dirty cops known collectively as <em>HR</em>) who protect and serve themselves and their criminal and mob friends. Including Fusco, who is assigned to work with Carter, and recruited by Reese as an inside source and dirty worker.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t run from the past forever, but love is real</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Season Two is definitely a cut above Season One. The characters are more rounded, there are more of them, their interactions and back stories are playing out and getting entangled. Finch and Fusco have, or had, love lives. Reese is looking out for Carter even though she&rsquo;s still officially hunting him. Reese acquires a killer Dutch dog called Bear and keeps him as a pet to protect Finch from the mysterious and powerful <em>root</em> who has been watching everything he does and who wants access to <em>The Machine</em>.</p>\n<p>Then, out of the blue, halfway through S2, I can&rsquo;t watch it anymore! Not without parting with £17.99! But by now I&rsquo;m hooked, watching an episode almost every evening. £17.99 gets me the information that it was Finch who ordered Reese and his duplicitous CIA partner to be killed in China, and sociopath Shaw joins the team after her old boss <em>Control</em> tried to kill her. My old boss&rsquo;s <em>doppelganger</em> turns up in one episode as a serial killer identity thief in a good old-fashioned <em>Columbo</em> episode where everyone is stuck on an island in the middle of a hurricane, and everyone except the killer is a suspect until it&rsquo;s (almost) too late. Fusco killed his old dirty cop partner Stills and buried him in the woods.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Carter and Bear dig up Stills&rsquo; body to save Fusco&rsquo;s ass</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finch gets captured by <em>root</em>. She wants to set <em>The Machine</em> free. It turns out Finch programmed <em>The Machine</em> to forget everything at the end of every day in an act of self-deletion. <em>root</em> seems to have some kind of connection with <em>The Machine</em> and sees it as a living organism.</p>\n<p>In Season Three, Carter brings down HR, including HR&rsquo;s chief henchman and all round bad guy Simmons. Or does she? No, she doesn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s somehow still alive. It&rsquo;s getting silly.</p>\n<p>Reese&rsquo;s number is up. By now, he&rsquo;s in love with Carter, and she&rsquo;s in love with him. She dies in his arms, shot in the chest by the evil Simmons, who escapes yet again. Simmons brutally tortures the now extremely likeable Fusco, breaking three of his fingers before sentencing both Fusco and his young son to death. Shaw manages to save Fusco&rsquo;s son, but she can&rsquo;t be in two places at once&hellip;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dirty cop turned hero</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Somehow, Fusco manages to free his ties and garrote his executioner before he can pull the trigger. Then he finds a strangely unarmed Simmons before he can fly to safety. But instead of shooting him, or even arresting him, he first decides to fist fight him with three broken fingers. Bear in mind that Simmons is hard as nails, and Fusco is short, fat, and a bit of a softie at heart.</p>\n<p>Against all the odds, Fusco wins and takes cop-killer Simmons in.</p>\n<p>After Carter&rsquo;s death, Reese goes AWOL and back on the bottle. Fusco finds him out west and they end up in a slapstick brawl in the rain. Meanwhile, Finch and Shaw are captured by the evil <em>Control</em> and her evil Odd Bod henchman Hersh, but miraculously saved by <em>root</em> (who by now had been captured and caged by Finch).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I got bored</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Halfway through S3 I gave up. Reese and Fusco miraculously saved Finch and Shaw, who were themselves captured by <em>Vigilance</em> (a violent pro-privacy campaign group), then Hersh. <em>root</em> was captured by <em>Control</em> and brutally tortured, but somehow managed to escape, turn the tables and then save everyone.</p>\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t mentioned the mysterious, sinister and extremely evil elderly Englishman who seemed to be running the whole show (actually the show&rsquo;s creator&rsquo;s grandfather in real life), who managed to look like death and worse than Michael Gambon in <em>The Singing Detective</em>.</p>\n<p>If you like guns, shooting people, torture, (mock) executions, (child) kidnapping, (attempted) murder, blackmail, gambling, Russian Roulette, cyber-stalking, identity theft, mob rule and police corruption, you&rsquo;ll probably like <em>Person of Interest</em>. I was into it for around fifty or so episodes, but it became too much, too repetitive, too cliched. They killed off the only J Carter, and I can&rsquo;t have that, even if J Bezos has another £17.99 from me.</p>\n",

He's the human embodiment of *The Machine* - *Superman*, infallible, with all the (ir)relevant information fed to him by Finch via an earpiece and every conceivable weapon, perfect timing and lucky escape available to him, along with miraculous recovery from injury. \n\nBetween them, they are all-seeing, all-knowing, and omnipresent, and the recipient of mysterious cryptic phone calls revealing the social security number of the next murder victim or perpetrator.\n\nSoon we start meeting new regular characters. The would-be mob boss working undercover as a shy, socially conscious high school teacher in the toughest area in town. The police homicide detective (one J Carter) looking for \"The man in the suit\" - Reese - who keeps being seen at the scene of the incredible deaths of various villains. The corrupt police officers (dirty cops known collectively as *HR*) who protect and serve themselves and their criminal and mob friends. Including Fusco, who is assigned to work with Carter, and recruited by Reese as an inside source and dirty worker.\n\n>You can't run from the past forever, but love is real\n\nSeason Two is definitely a cut above Season One. The characters are more rounded, there are more of them, their interactions and back stories are playing out and getting entangled. Finch and Fusco have, or had, love lives. Reese is looking out for Carter even though she's still officially hunting him. Reese acquires a killer Dutch dog called Bear and keeps him as a pet to protect Finch from the mysterious and powerful *root* who has been watching everything he does and who wants access to *The Machine*.\n\nThen, out of the blue, halfway through S2, I can't watch it anymore! Not without parting with £17.99! But by now I'm hooked, watching an episode almost every evening. £17.99 gets me the information that it was Finch who ordered Reese and his duplicitous CIA partner to be killed in China, and sociopath Shaw joins the team after her old boss *Control* tried to kill her. My old boss's *doppelganger* turns up in one episode as a serial killer identity thief in a good old-fashioned *Columbo* episode where everyone is stuck on an island in the middle of a hurricane, and everyone except the killer is a suspect until it's (almost) too late. Fusco killed his old dirty cop partner Stills and buried him in the woods. \n\n>Carter and Bear dig up Stills' body to save Fusco's ass\n\nFinch gets captured by *root*. She wants to set *The Machine* free. It turns out Finch programmed *The Machine* to forget everything at the end of every day in an act of self-deletion. *root* seems to have some kind of connection with *The Machine* and sees it as a living organism.\n\nIn Season Three, Carter brings down HR, including HR's chief henchman and all round bad guy Simmons. Or does she? No, she doesn't. He's somehow still alive. It's getting silly.\n\nReese's number is up. By now, he's in love with Carter, and she's in love with him. She dies in his arms, shot in the chest by the evil Simmons, who escapes yet again. Simmons brutally tortures the now extremely likeable Fusco, breaking three of his fingers before sentencing both Fusco and his young son to death. Shaw manages to save Fusco's son, but she can't be in two places at once....  \n\n>Dirty cop turned hero  \n\nSomehow, Fusco manages to free his ties and garrote his executioner before he can pull the trigger. Then he finds a strangely unarmed Simmons before he can fly to safety. But instead of shooting him, or even arresting him, he first decides to fist fight him with three broken fingers. Bear in mind that Simmons is hard as nails, and Fusco is short, fat, and a bit of a softie at heart.  \n\nAgainst all the odds, Fusco wins and takes cop-killer Simmons in. \n\nAfter Carter's death, Reese goes AWOL and back on the bottle. Fusco finds him out west and they end up in a slapstick brawl in the rain. Meanwhile, Finch and Shaw are captured by the evil *Control* and her evil Odd Bod henchman Hersh, but miraculously saved by *root* (who by now had been captured and caged by Finch).\n\n>I got bored  \n\nHalfway through S3 I gave up. Reese and Fusco miraculously saved Finch and Shaw, who were themselves captured by *Vigilance* (a violent pro-privacy campaign group), then Hersh. *root* was captured by *Control* and brutally tortured, but somehow managed to escape, turn the tables and then save everyone.\n\nI haven't mentioned the mysterious, sinister and extremely evil elderly Englishman who seemed to be running the whole show (actually the show's creator's grandfather in real life), who managed to look like death and worse than Michael Gambon in *The Singing Detective*.\n\nIf you like guns, shooting people, torture, (mock) executions, (child) kidnapping, (attempted) murder, blackmail, gambling, Russian Roulette, cyber-stalking, identity theft, mob rule and police corruption, you'll probably like *Person of Interest*. I was into it for around fifty or so episodes, but it became too much, too repetitive, too cliched. They killed off the only J Carter, and I can't have that, even if J Bezos has another £17.99 from me.\n",

The elusive holy grail of cheeses. From Gloucester.</li>\n<li>Double Gloucester. If you have trouble finding Triple Gloucester, then you can&rsquo;t go wrong with its populist sibling Double. Trump-like appearance, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not a vote-winner. Biden-like quality: good all-rounder, mild, creamy, child-friendly, goes with most things, melts easily. Oily. Used in cheese rolling competitions. From Gloucester.</li>\n<li>Single Gloucester. Pale and aloof, Double&rsquo;s estranged half-sister. From Gloucester.</li>\n<li>Mature Cheddar. Hard, white, crumbles under pressure. The epitome of Englishness in cheese form. Ideal in a cheese and tomato sandwich, or a Ploughman&rsquo;s lunch. <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2023/01/08/grated-cheese-to.html\">Mixes well (grated) with Double Gloucester</a>. From Cheddar.</li>\n<li>Vintage Mature Cheddar. See 4, but harder, whiter and crumblier.</li>\n<li>Mild Cheddar. See 4, but less pale, slightly softer, and less crumbly. Almost tasteless. Pointless waste of milk.</li>\n<li>Red Leicester. Underrated cheese. Red. Makes a fine cheese sauce for cauliflower or <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/22/yesterdays-mac-n.html\">macaroni</a>. Makes a great topping for a Shepherd&rsquo;s Pie (better than mixing Cheddar and Gloucester - Gloucester can get a bit oily). From Leicester.</li>\n<li>Wensleydale. White, crumbly. Perfect with a <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/13/not-the-most.html\">mince pie</a>. From Wensleydale.</li>\n<li>Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Cheshire. Lumping these all together not because they&rsquo;re are all the same, but because it&rsquo;s so long since I tried them I can&rsquo;t remember what they are like. From Lancashire, Lincolnshire and Cheshire.</li>\n<li>Gouda. Sliced foreign cheese. Kids eat it.</li>\n<li>Edam. A very special Dutch cheese which is made backwards. Don&rsquo;t eat the rind!</li>\n<li>Jarlsberg. Sliced foreign cheese. Full of holes.</li>\n<li>Emmental. Stringy cheese. Good for toasties and the bin.</li>\n<li>Swiss cheese. American cheese. From Switzerland.</li>\n<li>Brie. Fancy French cheese. Round, rindy, soft and stinky. Nice with a cracker.</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<ol start=\"17\">\n<li>Camembert. See 16. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8RmT094XH9g\">It&rsquo;s like no cheese I&rsquo;ve ever tasted</a>.</li>\n<li>Blue cheese. French. Mouldy. No thanks.</li>\n<li>Stilton. See 18. Not French. From Stilton.</li>\n<li>Ricotta. Soft, creamy. Perfect with spinach on a pizza, or better still in a <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2024/05/09/fear-and-loathing.html\">calzone at Pizza World</a>.</li>\n<li>Mozzarella. On a <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2024/10/19/i-thought-id.html\">pizza</a>.</li>\n<li>Mascarpone. In a cheesecake. Not a cake.</li>\n<li>Halloumi. Fried. On its own or with olives, hummus, pitta. From Cyprus.</li>\n<li>Feta. Greek salad. From Greece.</li>\n<li>Cottage cheese. My Mum loves it. From a cottage. From-age?</li>\n<li>Goats&rsquo; cheese. From goats.</li>\n<li>Sheep&rsquo;s cheese. See 26, but from sheep.</li>\n<li>Parmesan. Baby sick.</li>\n<li>Smegma. You don&rsquo;t want to know where it&rsquo;s from.

It refers to any manufacturers of dairy products.\n\nNow, I'm going to milk this for all it's worth, but I would question the last sentence. I'm going to stick to cheese. Not literally, of course. That would be messy and smelly. Always wash your hands after operating cheese.\n\nI'm going to stick to cheese, metaphorically - for the benefit of the cheeseless.\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-author=\"annie's micro(b)log\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/Annie/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://micro.blog/Annie/49637183\"><p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/davidmarsden\">[@davidmarsden](https://micro.blog/davidmarsden)</a> I am still waiting, cheeseless.</p>\n<footer>annie's micro(b)log <cite><a href=\"https://micro.blog/Annie/49637183\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">https://micro.blog/Annie/49637183</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://cdn.micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\n> [That's it!

Triple Gloucester. The elusive holy grail of cheeses. From Gloucester.\n2. Double Gloucester. If you have trouble finding Triple Gloucester, then you can't go wrong with its populist sibling Double. Trump-like appearance, but that doesn't mean it's not a vote-winner. Biden-like quality: good all-rounder, mild, creamy, child-friendly, goes with most things, melts easily. Oily. Used in cheese rolling competitions. From Gloucester.\n3. Single Gloucester. Pale and aloof, Double's estranged half-sister. From Gloucester.\n4. Mature Cheddar. Hard, white, crumbles under pressure. The epitome of Englishness in cheese form. Ideal in a cheese and tomato sandwich, or a Ploughman's lunch. [Mixes well (grated) with Double Gloucester](https://davidmarsden.info/2023/01/08/grated-cheese-to.html). From Cheddar.\n6. Vintage Mature Cheddar. See 4, but harder, whiter and crumblier. \n7. Mild Cheddar. See 4, but less pale, slightly softer, and less crumbly. Almost tasteless. Pointless waste of milk.\n8. Red Leicester. Underrated cheese. Red. Makes a fine cheese sauce for cauliflower or [macaroni](https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/22/yesterdays-mac-n.html). Makes a great topping for a Shepherd's Pie (better than mixing Cheddar and Gloucester - Gloucester can get a bit oily). From Leicester.\n9. Wensleydale. White, crumbly. Perfect with a [mince pie](https://davidmarsden.info/2024/11/13/not-the-most.html). From Wensleydale.\n10. Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Cheshire. Lumping these all together not because they're are all the same, but because it's so long since I tried them I can't remember what they are like. From Lancashire, Lincolnshire and Cheshire.\n11. Gouda. Sliced foreign cheese. Kids eat it.\n12. Edam. A very special Dutch cheese which is made backwards. Don't eat the rind!\n13. Jarlsberg. Sliced foreign cheese. Full of holes.\n14. Emmental. Stringy cheese. Good for toasties and the bin.\n15. Swiss cheese. American cheese. From Switzerland.\n16. Brie. Fancy French cheese. Round, rindy, soft and stinky. Nice with a cracker.\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2024/wallace-quote.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"608\" alt=\"\">\n\n17. Camembert. See 16. [It's like no cheese I've ever tasted](https://youtu.be/8RmT094XH9g).\n18. Blue cheese. French. Mouldy. No thanks.\n19. Stilton. See 18. Not French. From Stilton.\n20. Ricotta. Soft, creamy. Perfect with spinach on a pizza, or better still in a [calzone at Pizza World](https://davidmarsden.info/2024/05/09/fear-and-loathing.html).\n21. Mozzarella. On a [pizza](https://davidmarsden.info/2024/10/19/i-thought-id.html). \n22. Mascarpone. In a cheesecake. Not a cake.\n23. Halloumi. Fried. On its own or with olives, hummus, pitta. From Cyprus.\n24. Feta. Greek salad. From Greece.\n25. Cottage cheese. My Mum loves it. From a cottage. From-age?\n26. Goats' cheese. From goats.\n27. Sheep's cheese. See 26, but from sheep.\n28. Parmesan. Baby sick. \n29. Smegma. You don't want to know where it's from. One of the first bands I was in at school was called The Amgems. We weren't as good or as funny as we thought we were.\n30.

De Gea, Maguire, Wan Bissaka, Casemiro, McTominay, Sancho, Antony, Martial, Rashford, Greenwood. \n\nThe spineless corporate bosses meanwhile took an age to decide the safest bet was to keep ten Hag. Failure is expected and gives them half a season at least to bed themselves in and some new players, too, in time for a new manager. If he does well, then they made the right decision. If they had appointed a new manager he might have failed, too, with the current players, and that would have reflected badly on the corporate bosses.\n\nAt least we're not Chelsea. Telling your captain that he's not technically good enough. Successfully scraping through the play-off round of the Conference League. Moneyball gone mad (although they could have a decent team in three seasons...).\n",

It won't be missed, exactly, but it takes some getting used to, it not being here. \n\nI'll need to find somewhere else to write.\n",

Bed and board were included in my pay, which meant I didn&rsquo;t get paid much at all, and had to do a <em>lot</em> of household chores on a strict rota, along with the other, er, <em>residents</em>.</p>\n<p>I got kicked out about six months later for dropping acid at the weekend.

So he must have been 80 or so when we met him. Not so old these days, but back then he really was like a dinosaur, or a fossil.\n\nI remember a couple of stories about him. After the Great War, when he was a young man with a new wife and baby daughter (my grandmother), he had to walk twenty-five miles to work, where he would labour hard for sixteen hours before walking home again, only to be brutally murdered by his father before going to bed and getting up the next morning to do the same thing over and over again. Well, he certainly had to work hard, just to survive and raise a family. \n\nLife was no doubt much harder then than any of us can really imagine, but [you try and tell that to the young people of today. Would they believe you? No!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKHFZBUTA4k)\n\nMy great grandmother, Ellen, was committed to Lancaster Asylum some time after my grandmother Freda was born. I don't know what the reason was, but it's possible it was because she was suffering from what would now be recognised as post-natal depression.\n\nIn those days, it was a life sentence, not to mention the shame it brought upon the family.\n\nFrank divorced Ellen and married \"Auntie Florrie\". I don't know if Florrie was actually Ellen's sister, but it's possible.\n\nFreda never forgot her mum, and secretly visited her whenever she could.\n\nWhen Frank got the cancer that would kill him, Freda took him in and looked after him in her bed until he died.\n",

It&rsquo;s all barricaded off, with heavy machinery, waste skips and various bits of equipment.</p>\n<p>So the road is now a no through road, with access only for residents and deliveries.</p>\n<p>My kids and their friends have really enjoyed playing out in the street whenever they can, thanks also to our &ldquo;Indian Summer&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are plenty of drivers who ignore (or don&rsquo;t see?) the signs telling them the road is closed, and drive down it anyway.

Pretty much everyone had a car, and many of the houses had their own garage.\n\nIn London, or Greater London, it's generally not safe for kids to play in the street, although we're lucky where we are that our little *cul-de-sac* can double-up as a relatively safe enough play area most of the time.\n\nThe road next to us is an HGV Access Road, thanks to our local ward councillor and current council leader.\n\nIt's definitely NOT safe for kids to play in at all.\n\nNot until the Water Company came along. For the past two or three weeks, they have closed part of the road where my sons' friends live to clear the pipes of wet wipes, sanitary products, fat and oil.\n\nThey've dug a massive hole in the road, which I've told my nine year old is [*The Pit of Tartarus*](https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/06/class.html). It's all barricaded off, with heavy machinery, waste skips and various bits of equipment.\n\nSo the road is now a no through road, with access only for residents and deliveries.\n\nMy kids and their friends have really enjoyed playing out in the street whenever they can, thanks also to our \"Indian Summer\".\n\nOf course, there are plenty of drivers who ignore (or don't see?) the signs telling them the road is closed, and drive down it anyway. My job was mostly to tell them, \"No, you can't drive on the pavement. Can't you see there are kids playing? Plus, it's a pavement. This isn't the Wild West!\" \n\nFortunately, everyone was reasonable enough when challenged to back away, turnaround and drive around following the \"diverted traffic\" signs.\n\nThankfully, my job was made redundant by the older kids in the group, who took it upon themselves to relieve me of my onerous duties. They barricaded the pavements with spare cones, and now they marshall the traffic. Much more effective!\n",

Berkeley responded to this request\nand offered a £500 contribution to the event. However, while the offer was publicly acknowledged, the\nmoney was never accepted or received because the Council is committed to not accept sponsorship\nfrom Berkeley for corporate events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The FOI response on the council&rsquo;s relationship with developers was, to my mind, wholly unsatisfactory and generated <a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/ealing_councils_relationships_wi#outgoing-1498781\">a third FOI</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In other words, plain English perhaps, it took two years to put in place any formal procedure to uphold the Leader&rsquo;s stated aims, and there is literally nothing to see to evidence that councillors are following the procedure, or will do. And the fact that there is nothing to see to evidence your claims is, you claim, an indication of the council&rsquo;s commitment to transparency?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s my reply to his reply (via his Head of Cabinet Office).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for passing on Cllr Mason&rsquo;s response. Please pass this on to him.</p>\n<p>I appreciate Cllr Mason&rsquo;s honesty in acknowledging that the Mayor accepted Berkeley Group&rsquo;s offer of sponsorship, contrary to council policy.</p>\n<p>I also appreciate that the Mayor, councillors and officers have been reminded of the policy going forward.</p>\n<p>However, the Mayor&rsquo;s original tweet still stands, published, thanking Berkeley Group for sponsoring the event.</p>\n<p>I would like to know why this tweet has not been retracted or clarified, because it continues to give what I am now asked to believe by Cllr Mason is a wholly misleading statement of Ealing Council policy, as well as free good marketing publicity for what is a proscribed organisation. That&rsquo;s even worse than accepting sponsorship. (I hope that Berkeley Group were asked to donate their sponsorship directly to one of the Mayor&rsquo;s charities instead.)</p>\n<p>I would like Cllr Mason, the council leader, to ensure that the Mayor removes and publicly clarifies and apologises for his tweet, and mistakenly accepting Berkeley&rsquo;s offer. I would like him to explain why it was a mistake and why it&rsquo;s necessary to apologise.</p>\n<p>In Southall, we&rsquo;ve suffered, as Cllr Mason recently acknowledged in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/M_vj2l2_JuY\">one of his self-promotion videos</a>, six years of &ldquo;many, many terrible smells and certainly some bad chemicals released into the environment&rdquo;, which have undoubtedly caused long-term mental and physical health problems for residents young and old.</p>\n<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t need to remind anyone that Southall is home to by far the largest South Asian and Black community in Ealing, and the lowest average incomes, who are among the most vulnerable to the adverse health impacts of these &ldquo;bad chemicals&rdquo;. In addition, Southall residents live with some of the worst air pollution in Ealing from traffic congestion, FM Conway asphalt plant, and non-permitted incinerators. Some environmental justice campaigners describe this as a &ldquo;sacrifice zone&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>So, it&rsquo;s very hurtful, insulting and offensive to people in Southall, who have suffered and sacrificed so much, to see the new Mayor break the council leader&rsquo;s pledge, and offer no public retraction, acknowledgement, clarification or apology. It&rsquo;s as if his words have no consequences. It&rsquo;s as if South Asian and Black lives don&rsquo;t matter, or South Asian and Blacks don&rsquo;t count.</p>\n<p>I would also question how the offer of sponsorship came about. We all know that the person responsible for &ldquo;Community Liaison&rdquo; for Berkeley Group is Jags Sanghera, who was a Labour Party councillor candidate in last year&rsquo;s local elections. Why is Jags, who came close to being elected as a councillor, offering sponsorship to the Mayor? It does make me wonder if councillors (and prospective councillors) have ever been told of the council policy, and when? Not to mention the obvious conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>Will Cllr Mason establish a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy for accepting sponsorship, gifts and hospitality going forward (and, perhaps, apply it retrospectively)?</p>\n<p>With regard to Cllr Jassal&rsquo;s participation in Berkeley Group&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Engagement&rdquo; steering group, I&rsquo;d have more confidence in Cllr Mason&rsquo;s assertion that this is to hold them to account if the group wasn&rsquo;t set up and controlled by Berkeley Group and Jags Sanghera. Were CASH invited to be members? Was I? No. Why not? Because as far as I can see, we are among the only people who do consistently try to hold Berkeley Group to account, and their relationship with the council.</p>\n<p>As Cllr Mason addressed his reply to me to Angela and CASH as well, I&rsquo;ve copied them in to this.</p>\n<p>Yours&hellip;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

However, while the offer was publicly acknowledged, the \nmoney was never accepted or received because the Council is committed to not accept sponsorship \nfrom Berkeley for corporate events. \n\nThe FOI response on the council's relationship with developers was, to my mind, wholly unsatisfactory and generated [a third FOI](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/ealing_councils_relationships_wi#outgoing-1498781):\n\n> In other words, plain English perhaps, it took two years to put in place any formal procedure to uphold the Leader's stated aims, and there is literally nothing to see to evidence that councillors are following the procedure, or will do. And the fact that there is nothing to see to evidence your claims is, you claim, an indication of the council's commitment to transparency?\n\nAnyway, here's my reply to his reply (via his Head of Cabinet Office).\n\n------------\n\nThanks for passing on Cllr Mason's response. Please pass this on to him.\n\nI appreciate Cllr Mason's honesty in acknowledging that the Mayor accepted Berkeley Group's offer of sponsorship, contrary to council policy.\n\nI also appreciate that the Mayor, councillors and officers have been reminded of the policy going forward.\n\nHowever, the Mayor's original tweet still stands, published, thanking Berkeley Group for sponsoring the event.\n\nI would like to know why this tweet has not been retracted or clarified, because it continues to give what I am now asked to believe by Cllr Mason is a wholly misleading statement of Ealing Council policy, as well as free good marketing publicity for what is a proscribed organisation. That's even worse than accepting sponsorship. (I hope that Berkeley Group were asked to donate their sponsorship directly to one of the Mayor's charities instead.)\n\nI would like Cllr Mason, the council leader, to ensure that the Mayor removes and publicly clarifies and apologises for his tweet, and mistakenly accepting Berkeley's offer. I would like him to explain why it was a mistake and why it's necessary to apologise. \n\nIn Southall, we've suffered, as Cllr Mason recently acknowledged in [one of his self-promotion videos](https://youtu.be/M_vj2l2_JuY), six years of \"many, many terrible smells and certainly some bad chemicals released into the environment\", which have undoubtedly caused long-term mental and physical health problems for residents young and old. \n\nI hope I don't need to remind anyone that Southall is home to by far the largest South Asian and Black community in Ealing, and the lowest average incomes, who are among the most vulnerable to the adverse health impacts of these \"bad chemicals\". In addition, Southall residents live with some of the worst air pollution in Ealing from traffic congestion, FM Conway asphalt plant, and non-permitted incinerators. Some environmental justice campaigners describe this as a \"sacrifice zone\". \n\nSo, it's very hurtful, insulting and offensive to people in Southall, who have suffered and sacrificed so much, to see the new Mayor break the council leader's pledge, and offer no public retraction, acknowledgement, clarification or apology. It's as if his words have no consequences. It's as if South Asian and Black lives don't matter, or South Asian and Blacks don't count. \n\nI would also question how the offer of sponsorship came about. We all know that the person responsible for \"Community Liaison\" for Berkeley Group is Jags Sanghera, who was a Labour Party councillor candidate in last year's local elections. Why is Jags, who came close to being elected as a councillor, offering sponsorship to the Mayor? It does make me wonder if councillors (and prospective councillors) have ever been told of the council policy, and when? Not to mention the obvious conflict of interest.\n\nWill Cllr Mason establish a \"zero tolerance\" policy for accepting sponsorship, gifts and hospitality going forward (and, perhaps, apply it retrospectively)?\n\nWith regard to Cllr Jassal's participation in Berkeley Group's \"Community Engagement\" steering group, I'd have more confidence in Cllr Mason's assertion that this is to hold them to account if the group wasn't set up and controlled by Berkeley Group and Jags Sanghera. Were CASH invited to be members? Was I? No. Why not? Because as far as I can see, we are among the only people who do consistently try to hold Berkeley Group to account, and their relationship with the council.\n\nAs Cllr Mason addressed his reply to me to Angela and CASH as well, I've copied them in to this.\n\nYours...\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-title=\"\" data-author=\"David Marsden\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/davidmarsden/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2023/07/07/open-letter-to.html\">Open letter to Peter Mason  <img src=\"https://micro.blog/photos/50/https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/20230701-1318193.jpg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" class=\"mini_thumbnail\">  <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2023/07/07/open-letter-to.html\">davidmarsden.info</a><footer>David Marsden <cite><a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2023/07/07/open-letter-to.html\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">https://davidmarsden.info/2023/07/07/open-letter-to.html</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n",

That may be true, but I didn't *feel* safer, and there were no [buses to flag down](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/01/police-must-win-back-public-confidence-after-sarah-everard-case-says-minister).\n\nThe children learned that murderous megalomaniac misogynist King Henry VIII is still held in very high regard in these parts, despite beheading two of his six wives, and creating a new religion and laws to divorce two more.\n\nI asked the children how the chamber of the House of Lords made them feel.\n\n> Small.\n\nWe had lunch across the road outside Portcullis House where we could shelter a little from the wind and rain. Portcullis House is where elected Members of Parliament (MP) and their staff have offices. There were lots of posh-looking mostly white men going in and out and getting frisked inside by more armed guards. Out in the cold, we shared our lunch with toothless and homeless Len, who we found sleeping in the doorway next to us, and looking very wet and cold. Len told us he was \"a midget, a dwarf from Burnley\" and he'd come to London to sort his life out, but his marriage failed and here he was. He was very pleased to have a homemade tuna mayonnaise sandwich, a juice drink and a satsuma. My wife told me off when we got home, claiming that he will have sold or exchanged the sandwich for drugs.\n\nWe waited for our own MP [Virendra Sharma](https://davidmarsden.info/2022/02/11/trigger-vote-for.html) to come and meet us as the teachers had arranged. No one knew what he looked like, so they asked me as my lad told them I had met him before (which is true). Then we played a game \"Where's Sharma?\" until he appeared. Mr Sharma thanked the kids for coming to meet him, and asked them who wanted his job. His two assistants took photographs.\n\nWe ended the day by getting drenched walking up to see Downing Street and the Horse Guards Parade. Downing Street was, of course, guarded by more armed police and totally inaccessible to us ordinary folk, and the parade smelled of horse shit.\n",

I&rsquo;ll say more on these later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve air quality</li>\n<li>Tackling the climate crisis</li>\n<li>Fighting inequality</li>\n<li>Protect biodiversity</li>\n<li>Protect health and wellbeing</li>\n<li>Raise public awareness</li>\n<li>Promote sustainable infrastructure</li>\n<li>Support the transition to clean energy</li>\n<li>Creating good jobs</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"inequalities\">Inequalities</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/30e2e26fd7.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\"></p>\n<p><em>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk in Ealing&rsquo;s air quality strategy about being inclusive and &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; (&ldquo;reducing&rdquo; would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; (&ldquo;exhaust trail&rdquo; might be more apt?). I&rsquo;m not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"public-health-policy\">Public Health Policy</h3>\n<p>The strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks.</p>\n<p><em>When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action</a>), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we&rsquo;ll see later, promoting active travel.</em></p>\n<p>In contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio</a>).</p>\n<p>*There&rsquo;s obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Good Growth</a>), and social policy (<a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Tackling Inequalities</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.</strong></p>\n<p>The strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant.</p>\n<p><em>Ealing&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profiles/2019/E09000009.html?area-name=Ealing\">Health Profile from 2019</a> puts that figure in some context:</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/79dfdefa37.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Ealing&rsquo;s 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\" title=\"Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"air-pollution-in-ealing\">Air Pollution in Ealing</h2>\n<h3 id=\"pollution-sources\">Pollution Sources</h3>\n<p>The strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy.</p>\n<p>Those most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women.</p>\n<p><strong>It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo;, especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).</strong></p>\n<p><em>I don&rsquo;t believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.</em></p>\n<p>The strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.</p>\n<p><em>Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/b3477cab4c.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\"></p>\n<p><em>On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/6301e51513.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\"></p>\n<p><em>In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn&rsquo;t get a look-in at all, data from 2013.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/a517ab2e6a.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\"></p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council&rsquo;s key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.</em></p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"air-quality-monitoring\">Air Quality Monitoring</h3>\n<p>The strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/601d0ed36b.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\"></p>\n<p><em>It&rsquo;s worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/pm2.5_in_london_october19.pdf\" title=\"PDF\">background levels of PM2.5</a> in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO&rsquo;s target.</em></p>\n<p>The draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.</p>\n<p>Ealing has 67 air quality monitors acrosss the borough, all recording levels of notrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulater matter (PM10 only).</p>\n<p><em>It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although their are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as <a href=\"https://www.airqualityengland.co.uk/local-authority/?la_id=191\" title=\"Air Quality England: Southall monitors\">The Green Quarter</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Ealing publishes annual air quality <a href=\"https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/Reports.aspx\">status reports</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Ealing also has <a href=\"https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/DiffusionTubes.aspx\">an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites</a> where you can see graphical annual data summary charts.

Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council&rsquo;s response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn&rsquo;t give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Wouldn&rsquo;t this be fantastic?! Again, the Council&rsquo;s response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents&rsquo; needs for clean air first, and above developers&rsquo; desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Invest in green infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Southall has the least <a href=\"https://www.ealingitree.online/stories/canopy-cover/0\" title=\"Tree canopy cover in Ealing\">tree canopy cover in Ealing</a>, yet is subjected to <a href=\"https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns\" title=\"Over-development of Southall\">massive overdevelopment</a>. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.</em></p>\n<p><em>The one concession negotiated hard for by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the &lsquo;reset&rsquo; button. Having sat on the Mayor&rsquo;s money and done nothing for so long it&rsquo;s no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new &lsquo;pocket park&rsquo; outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-&lsquo;orchards&rsquo; planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the &lsquo;Poison Park&rsquo; to look forward to, the &lsquo;green space&rsquo; crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.</em></p>\n<p><strong>If the council&rsquo;s air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a &lsquo;compromise&rsquo; to <a href=\"https://ealing.news/environment/environmentalists-tell-ealing-council-and-its-leader-peter-mason-their-actions-will-result-in-ecocide-and-are-environmentally-reckless-and-ecologically-illiterate-over-warren-farm-sports-p\" title=\"Ealing News coverage of Warren Farm story\">destroy most of the already re-wilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall</a> in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don&rsquo;t want.

It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”.

We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!</p>\n<h3 id=\"public-health\">Public Health</h3>\n<p>We are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. <strong>Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?</strong> The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?</p>\n<p>Moreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years&rsquo; of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. <strong>Why wasn&rsquo;t truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"enforcement\">Enforcement</h3>\n<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?</p>\n<p>The council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks.

The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. <strong>Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/ffb64911e1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don&rsquo;t reduce air pollution\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution\"></p>\n<p>b. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. <strong>Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.</strong></p>\n<p>c. Another low impact scheme was Play Streets. <strong>How many Play Streets are there now? How often do they run? Where are they?</strong></p>\n<p>d. <strong>How many Pocket Parks are there?

				"content_text": "Ealing Council's [draft Air Quality Strategy][1] is a 64 page document together with a 40 page [Action Plan][2], and the consultation period runs until 30 January 2023. It's taken me the best part of six weeks, all my spare time over Christmas and New Year, to get through it all, make notes and cross-reference to try to make sense of it all and offer some feedback. \n\nReally, there must be a much longer consultation period if Ealing Council is genuinely interested in residents' views.\n\nThe following is a summary of what the key points of interest are for me, and in particular in relation to Southall, where I live and work. My additional suggestions are **in bold**, and my comments and questions in *italics*.\n\n#### Warning\n\nThis is a LONG post. I've tried to break it into sections to make it easier to read.\n\n#### Disclaimer \n\n*I don't claim to be an expert, other than through experience. I am just an ordinary resident living in the midst of four major industrial and construction site polluters for several years. I have campaigned alongside my family, neighbours and friends for clean air after my then nearly four year old said he wanted fresh air not stinky air. He'd been hospitalised three times when he was two and diagnosed with asthma. We soon discovered people who had lost loved ones, had heart attacks, ectopic pregnancies, cancer, all attributed to the foul petrochemical stink.*\n\n*I welcome any corrections.*\n\n# My Summary\n\n**If Ealing is serious about \"fighting\" inequalities, action must be targeted to protect vulnerable people in Southall to reduce air pollution and its impact on the health of its large, mostly economically deprived and non-white population.**\n\n**The Strategy and Plan must target children and older people, people with lung conditions, and pregnant women: outside schools and school run hours. The Council must question if it is ethical to promote active travel in Southall when it knows that it is a high pollution area and that most of its population is particularly vulnerable to its adverse health impacts.**\n\nThe draft strategy and action plan don't do this at all.\n\n---\n\n# Clean Air for Ealing!\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/35d32fbea6.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents\")\n\n*To begin, I think it’s fantastic that Ealing Council has stated its vision for clean air for all Ealing residents, in alignment with that of local residents’ campaign group [Clean Air for Southall and Hayes][3] (CASH).*\n\n*CASH has been [asking for clean air for residents in Southall and Hayes since 2018][4].*\n\n![Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a comminity group fighting for our righ to breathe clean air](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/4bb932f46f.png \"Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a comminity group fighting for our righ to breathe clean air\")\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the Strategy and Action Plan\n\nEaling's draft air quality strategy's five stated priorities are to:\n\n> - Reduce road traffic emissions\n> - Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning\n> - Reduce emissions from construction of new developments\n> - Invest in green infrastructure\n> - Raise awareness of air quality\n\n**It would be useful to see the strategy and action plan follow the same structure with clear definitions of terms, and specific and detailed aims and objectives for each priority, along with baseline air pollution levels and equalities data for each in order to monitor and measure impact.**\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/8fc38abd8c.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport\")\n\nSomewhat confusingly, the action plan groups its actions into six categories: \n\n> - Emissions from Developments and Buildings\n> - Public health and awareness raising\n> - Delivery servicing and freight\n> - Borough fleet actions\n> - Localised solutions\n> - Cleaner transport\n\n*This maybe because they are copied and pasted from the previous [2017-22 action plan][5].*\n\n**It would be better for understanding, monitoring and evaluation to have consistency and coherence between the two documents, updating the action plan where necessary to reflect this.**\n\nAlso somewhat confusingly, Ealing's draft air quality strategy has nine stated goals, starting with the obvious. I'll say more on these later:\n\n> 1. Improve air quality\n> 2. Tackling the climate crisis\n> 3. Fighting inequality\n> 4. Protect biodiversity\n> 5. Protect health and wellbeing\n> 6. Raise public awareness\n> 7. Promote sustainable infrastructure\n> 8. Support the transition to clean energy\n> 9. Creating good jobs\n\n---\n\n### Inequalities \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/30e2e26fd7.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\")\n\n*There's a lot of talk in Ealing's air quality strategy about being inclusive and \"fighting\" (\"reducing\" would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution \"footprint\" (\"exhaust trail\" might be more apt?). I'm not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.*\n\n---\n\n### Public Health Policy\n\nThe strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks. \n\n*When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the [Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action][6]), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we'll see later, promoting active travel.*\n\nIn contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing's [Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio][6]).\n\n*There's obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or [Good Growth][6]), and social policy ([Tackling Inequalities][6]). \n\n**It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.**\n\nThe strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant. \n\n*Ealing's [Health Profile from 2019][7] puts that figure in some context:*\n\n![Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/79dfdefa37.png \"Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\")\n\n---\n\n## Air Pollution in Ealing\n\n### Pollution Sources \n\nThe strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy. \n\nThose most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women. \n\n**It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution \"hotspots\", especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).** \n\n*I don't believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.*\n\nThe strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.\n\n*Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).*\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/b3477cab4c.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\")\n\n*On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):*\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/6301e51513.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\")\n\n*In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn't get a look-in at all, data from 2013.* \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/a517ab2e6a.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\")\n\n**It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.**\n\n*The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council's key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.* \n\n**It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.**\n\n---\n\n### Air Quality Monitoring \n\nThe strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/601d0ed36b.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\")\n\n*It's worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the [background levels of PM2.5][8] in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO's target.*\n\nThe draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.\n\nEaling has 67 air quality monitors acrosss the borough, all recording levels of notrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulater matter (PM10 only). \n\n*It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although their are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as [The Green Quarter][9].*\n\nEaling publishes annual air quality [status reports][10].\n\n*Ealing also has [an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites][11] where you can see graphical annual data summary charts. Unfortunately, none seem to have been updated since 2021.*\n\n![Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/7736b00dee.png \"Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021\") \n\n**It would be useful to have more monitors for particulate matter, especially PM2.5, across the borough, and in Southall, and for published data from all air pollution monitors to be kept accessible and up-to-date.**\n\n---\n\n## Priorities for Action\n\nBack to the strategy's priorities for action, and my *comments and questions*, and **suggestions**.\n\n> - Reduce road traffic emissions. \n\n*The biggest reduction in road traffic emissions came during 2020 covid lockdowns, and while it's not practical, feasible or desirable to replicate that going forward, it might be worth promoting the idea that employers should encourage and support an increase to the 36% of Ealing's working age population already mainly [working from home][12] whenever possible, as opposed to the current political groupthink that everyone must return to the office in order to be productive.*\n\n> - Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning. \n\n*There are two wood-burning incinerators close to my home, which frequently create disgusting burning plastic odours forcing us to stay indoors and close all our windows. Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council's response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn't give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.*\n\n> - Reduce emissions from construction of new developments. \n\n*Wouldn't this be fantastic?! Again, the Council's response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?*\n\n> - Invest in green infrastructure. \n\n*Southall has the least [tree canopy cover in Ealing][13], yet is subjected to [massive overdevelopment][14]. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.* \n\n*The one concession negotiated hard for by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the 'reset' button. Having sat on the Mayor's money and done nothing for so long it's no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new 'pocket park' outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-'orchards' planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the 'Poison Park' to look forward to, the 'green space' crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.*\n\n**If the council's air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.** \n\n*Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a 'compromise' to [destroy most of the already re-wilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall][15] in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don't want. I don't understand how the Leader's desires complement the Council's stated strategies to reduce air pollution, tackle the climate emergency they declared, and to protect and promote biodiversity and our ecosystem.*\n\n- Raise awareness of air quality. \n\n*The council also wants to (and must) lead by example.* \n\n**If the council really wants to lead by example on reducing air pollution, then the council Leader cannot accept or request car rides to or from meetings in Southall, councillors cannot park in cycle lanes in Southall, nor fly to the property developer festival in the south of France. They must engage with Southall residents suffering the worst of the air pollution from multiple sources, and stop denying or minimising the existence and extent of the problems, and proactively and collaboratively work to reduce or stop such pollution episodes continuing.** \n\n*Otherwise, the council's strategy isn't worth the virtual paper it's printed on, and is just more hot air.*\n\n*What we have in the draft plan, however, is largely a copy-and-paste of the previous 2017-2022 plan, which was, at worst, a demonstrable failure of ambition, leadership and political will, and, at best, a simple failure of the council to do what it said it would do.*\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Goals\n\n> 1. Improve air quality. Protect the health and wellbeing of Ealing residents from the harmful effects\n> of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) air pollution. \n\n**The strategy MUST have the inclusive goal of protecting residents from the harmful effects of ALL air pollutants (not just nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter).**.\n\n> 2. Tackling the climate crisis.... by aiming for the highest environmental standards. \n\n**The \"highest environmental standards\" must be clearly stated and defined.**\n\n> 3. Fighting inequality.... to ensure that no-one is left behind... [and] residents feel safe. \n\n**The strategy must ensure that inequalities are reduced, that ALL residents are included in this process, and that their concerns for the safety of their air are taken seriously and acted upon.** *Promoting the uptake of expensive electric vehicles and discounting parking spaces for them is discriminating against economically deprived mostly non-white people who suffer most from air pollution.*\n\n> 4. Protect biodiversity. Ensuring our parks, open spaces and nature are protected and enhanced. \n\n*This is particularly relevant right now, as the Council Leader pushes on with his undemocratic desire to destroy much of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall, and killing off a quarter of London's endangered skylarks, in order to build new sports pitches and/or a football stadium.*\n\n> 5. Protect health and wellbeing. Protecting and enhancing the physical and mental health of all. \n\n*Except in Southall? [Public Health England's four risk assessment reports][16] into the Southall Gasworks poisoning clearly stated that \"Odours can cause nuisance amongst the population possibly leading to stress and anxiety. Some people may experience symptoms such as nausea, headaches or dizziness.\"*\n\n> 6. Raise public awareness. Promoting awareness of the causes and impacts of air quality issues, as well as the available local solutions.... encouraging community activism.... \n\n*Except in Southall? At every opportunity, Ealing Council has sought to erase, deny or minimise the the causes and impacts of air quality issues related to Southall Gasworks, refused to enforce any local solutions, and actively discouraged and attempted to prevent community activists' voices from being heard.*\n\n> 7. Promote sustainable infrastructure. Ensure local transport and development planning supports investment in sustainable infrastructure, that limits impact on air quality, enabling a shift to low-emission transport and energy options. \n\n*Except in Southall? The Council recently [decided NOT to widen the South Road bridge in Southall][17]. Widening the bridge, as promised, would ease congestion, and improve air quality, public transport and active travel options. The bridge widening was the one concession granted to the Southall community when the London Mayor overruled local democracy to give the go ahead to developement of the highly contaminated Southall Gasworks site.*\n\n> 8. Support the transition to clean energy. Supporting the uptake of low-emission energy technologies and improvements in efficiencies, and reducing reliance on the consumption of fossil and solid fuels. \n\n*Like [in Chile][18]? Simply promoting and encouraging more (low emission) cars isn’t going to reduce congestion, emissions from brake and tyre wear, or help to reduce our “reliance on the consumption of fossil fuels”. Ealing [reportedly doesn’t have enough power on the electricity grid for new homes until 2030][19].* \n\n> 9. Creating good jobs. We want to... deliver an ambitious programme of building more genuinely affordable homes. \n\n*Ealing is [building fewer genuinely affordable homes than ever][20], and [making the housing crisis in Ealing worse][21] by [demolishing more social rent homes][22] than it is building.*\n\n---\n\n## Spotlight on Southall \n\nThese are all my comments, so I'm not putting it all in *italics.*\n\nMy suggestions and questions for the strategy are still in **bold.**\n\n**Southall cannot be used as a good example of how Ealing Council takes air pollution seriously.** \n\n### Inequalities\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/6a220c535f.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people\") \n\nSouthall has a [BAME population of more than 90%][23].\n\nSouthall Broadway/West and Southall Green are the two council wards that border the old Gasworks site, and which are downwind from the FM Conway asphalt and Tarmac plants, and the two wood-burning incinerators, depending on wind direction. They are connected by the Gasworks site and by the Air Quality Focus Area from South Road to The Green, King Street and Western Road.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/bbcfb05232.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites\")\n\nSouthall is already a high pollution area (and an Air Quality Focus Area as a result), but has several additive sources of unmitigated, uncontrolled air pollution.\n\nEconomically poorer, BAME people, children, older people and pregnant women are the most vulnerable to the health impacts of toxic air pollution. Certainly not a fairer start for Southall’s children.\n\nWe know from bitter experience over the last six years in Southall that the council has failed in its duty to protect some of its most vulnerable residents from harm.\n\n### Raising Awareness\n\nTo add insult to injury, the council failed to raise public awareness of the risks and the air quality monitoring data in an open and transparent manner before work on the site began, and while the work was in progress. It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”. Residents were never informed if, when or how levels of naphthalene were urgently reduced.\n\n![Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/16631f69b8.png \"Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\")\n\nIt’s noteworthy that the Council claims it asked PHE to get involved only [“following concerns raised by local residents”][24] and not because the Council itself carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment prior to works starting in 2016, knowing that the Southall population was significantly more vulnerable to air pollution due to high pre-existing levels and multiple inequalities.\n\nSimilarly, the council says it responded to residents' concerns by installing \"independent\" air quality monitors on site in 2021, but this is five years after the work started, and two years after the main source of air pollution and odour complaints (the so-called soil \"hospital\") was decommissioned. The monitors now installed record near-real time data for “urban background” emissions of odourless particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/e8d8fc3af0.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns\")\n\nThe odours and air pollution that residents are concerned about originate from polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (i.e., the hundred years’ of toxic waste from town gas, coal tar and petrochemical work sites). We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!\n\n### Public Health\n\nWe are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. **Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?** The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?\n\nMoreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years' of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and \"cleaned\" in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. **Why wasn't truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?**\n\n### Enforcement\n\nWhy didn't the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?\n\nThe council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks. Indeed half of the plan was missing from the planning portal and [the council admitted that it didn't have a full copy of the original CMP][25]. \n\n**How on earth was the council planning to enforce a CMP it wasn’t in possession of?** This was a gross dereliction of duty to care for the health and wellbeing of (by its own definition) the most vulnerable residents in the borough.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/d485373622.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites\")\n\n**The Council was committed to full enclosure of waste sites in its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan. Why wasn’t the one hundred years of petrochemical waste \"soil cleaning hospital” enclosed?**\n\n[National Grid have enclosed their enclosed their soil remediation work][26] specifically to avoid causing odour nuisance to the local community (and thanks no doubt to campaigning by local residents and activists at Clean Air for Southall and Hayes).\n\n### On Whose Side?\n\nWhy did the former and current council leader [accept over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group][27] to fly (!) to the south of France for what Private Eye Magazine describes as [a booze and hookerfest][28]?\n\nThe new council leader claims he went there to negotiate hard. If that's the case, what did he negotiate? He also claimed that it wasn't what he expected and that it was a mistake to go. If that's also the case, [why was it a mistake][29]?\n\n**How can we be sure that the new council leader and his administration won't continue making these mistakes and taking the side of developers rather than standing up for the residents they are elected to represent?**\n\n### Local  Action\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/c66801e7f1.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response\")\n\n**If the soil is now clean and the air is safe to breathe, why would stopping works during hot weather (which didn’t happen in 2018), and covering stockpiles (why weren’t they covered already?) be given as examples of possible mitigating actions?**\n\n**There must be a new commitment to work with and for residents where these are issues. Air pollution and odour nuisance reporting and investigation procedures need to be overhauled as they are currently not fit for purpose (reporting process too convoluted, each one investigated as a single, isolated incident rather than as part of an ongoing problem, residents are simply not believed and our reports are minimised and invalidated).** \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/d0a9b295be.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality\")\n\n**Work on the Gasworks site is due to complete in 2038. Why is the date for net-zero emissions set for twelve years after this date in 2050?**\n\nThere's a similar commitment to target zero-emissions for construction vehicles by 2040, which is two years after the new draft local Plan period for new developments ends. \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/c4e6ee2c8e.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers\")\n\n**What has Ealing Council done to date to campaign for greater regulatory powers and for a Clean Air Act? Please give examples.**\n\nThis draft Air Quality Strategy is fine in many respects in terms of the words it contains, but what concerns me is that these are empty words if they are not acted on and enforced.\n\nRecent history strongly suggests the council doesn't have the leadership, organisational culture or political will to act in the interests of its most vulnerable residents in Southall.\n\n### Active Travel\n\nThere's a lot of talk about active travel and Ealing Council's multi-million pound Let's Go Southall campaign in the draft Strategy, but [very little on its real cost and impact][31]. They seem to have about 50 regular weekly activity groups. Over two years that's 5,000 sessions. 30,000 attendances (not individuals). So average of six people per session? 1,000 people attended at least two sessions (repeat attendances). My guess would be not many more than 1,000 in total, most will be repeaters (thinking GP referrals, lots of organisers?). If it's helped 1,000 individuals, that's £5,400 per person. If 10,000 it's £540 per person (still seems like a lot of money). And there's no evidence that it's helped anyone! \n\n**The council must be open and transparent with residents that Let's Go Southall is a top-down neoliberal behavioural change (\"nudge theory\") programme led by a retired stockbroker, and not the \"grassroots social movement\" of the council's Orwellian publicity.**\n\n**If the Council is serious about improving safe active travel options in Southall, then it must improve road and pavement conditions and safety first. Many of the roads and pavements are not fit to cycle or walk on, especially for children and families, older people, and people with disabilities.**\n\n---\n\n# Air Quality Action Plan\n\n## The 2017-2022 Action Plan\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/da4994ee82.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution\")\n\na. Included a number of no-or-low-impact schemes such as Low Emission Neighbourhoods (LENs), implemented in 2021 as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. **Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?**\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/ffb64911e1.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution\")\n\nb. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. **Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.**\n\nc. Another low impact scheme was Play Streets. **How many Play Streets are there now? How often do they run? Where are they?**\n\nd. **How many Pocket Parks are there? Where are they?**\n\ne. **How many Green Screens  are there? Where are they? Why were green screens not erected at Southall Gasworks even after residents complained of dust from the site in their homes?**\n\nf. **How are these schemes evaluated in terms of reducing air pollution? Where are the air quality monitors located to record baseline measurements to compare against air pollution levels during or after the scheme is in place?**\n\ng. **Enforcement of anti-idling laws was deemed \"not cost-effective\". Smoke control was not deemed a problem and therefore not promoted or enforced. Who made these decisions?**\n\nh. **What is the wider 'cost' to residents in not taking enforcement action against these criminal behaviours?**\n\n## The 2022-2027 Action Plan (AQAP)\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/a6a7ae4c4e.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone\")\n\n**If air pollution monitoring data cannot inform the efficacy of individual actions, how can it be used in combination with secondary data to do so?** I'm sure there must be a sensible explanation, but to most people I suspect this statement makes little sense. In Southall, we have continuously been asked to ignore our own lived experience of health and quality of life problems attributed to the open-air 'cleaning' of a hundred years of petrochemical waste at the Gasworks site, in favour of the developer Berkeley's assurances that it's own monitoring of air quality is 'within acceptable limits' and harmless to health. Public Health England published four risk assessments based on Berkeley's data, and came to similar conclusions, although neither looked at any secondary data. The air pollution data has still to be published so that the public can make up their own minds.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/8b107c503e.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution\")\n\n![](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/4cd9b2f1fa.png)\n\nI'm not sure how imperceptible changes that cannot be detected by monitoring or modelling can be interpreted as Low Impact or a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Action Plan here seems to contradict the Strategy by stating that changes in the levels of air pollution above a certain level can be attributed even to individual actions (although more likely to be due to multiple actions).\n\n**If the council is serious about using air pollution data and secondary data to establish efficacy of its air quality strategy and action plan, (which sounds sensible enough), then it must explain what measures it will use, and publish baseline data and regular updates.** \n\nLike it does with its [performance dashboard][30].  \n  \nLooking at the Council's own evaluation of it's 2017-22 Action Plan, I would suggest that it's achievements are minimal, and misleading.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/2af9af507b.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan\")\n\nElectric Vehicle charging points (p. 30 of 2022 AQAP) were not actually a specified target in the 2017 AQAP, so I'm unsure how this can be claimed as an achievement? Similarly with School Streets and specific cycle lanes. LENS/LTNs were specified as a target, but there is no mention of that fiasco here. **Air quality monitoring data must be used to locate pollution hotspots for any future implementation of LENs/LTNs**\n\nThe 20 mph speed limit was implemented borough-wide, but only since December 2021. Why did it take so long? What is the use of it if it isn’t enforced, especially in Southall?  \n  \n[1]: https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7039/ealing_council_air_quality_strategy_2020-30\n\n[2]:

Labour Council. Our lives didn't matter to them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we are being asked to believe that our MP (who has begun making the right noises two years too late – what happened to the nearly 1,000 signature petition I gave you in 2018 Mr Sharma?) cares and is on our side, and that our local ward councillor cares and always has done. Only Bell is – unusually for him – honest enough not to suddenly pretend he gives a shit about anyone but himself and looking after his own family.</p>\n\n<p>At the packed public meeting in 2019, which our local ward councillor chaired, he and Bell refused to declare their financial interests with Berkeley Group, refused to let me speak with the microphone so that people couldn't hear that the Council, Berkeley Group, the Environment Agency and Public Health England had all colluded to cover up the real level of toxic and carcinogenic air pollution – that it was consistently above legal limits and rising – by manipulating, removing, and presenting the air quality data in such a way as to make it look like it was mostly within legal limits.</p>\n\n<p>At the same meeting, our MP arrived late, mostly unseen, sat silently at the back of the room, and left early, mostly unseen.\nAt the same meeting, a strangely truthful Bell admitted that he had 'known about the nuisance, the BAD nuisance, for two and a half years'! Yet nothing could be done.</p>\n\n<p>Now Peter Mason, free from his constraints as Head of Planning after resigning following his failed coup attempt to take the leadership from Bell last year, is telling us that something could and should have been done, yet all of them remained silent and did nothing for years.</p>\n\n<p>Unbelievable!</p>\n",

The most likely source I can think of is our communal stairwell to our flat, which we share with our next door neighbours and their visitors, posties, delivery drivers.</p>\n\n<p>When the pandemic began, we always used to wear a mask to go out, but we stopped doing that (and got out of the habit) in the summer when infection rates were low.

Practising prudent use of valuable PPE supplies, the midwives wore their own prescription spectacles to protect from splashes to the eyes. <em>(This is, of course, not true. They had NHS supplied aprons, surgical masks, and gloves.)</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"home-delivery\">Home delivery</h2>\n\n<p>Now, we've had our groceries, pizza and most other household and personal items delivered to our home, rather than dealing with the stress of actually going out and having to interact with other people, for years, so a home delivery of our new son might have seemed like an obvious choice.</p>\n\n<p>But a home birth was definitely Plan B, and only came to be Plan A due to coronavirus related issues with hospital birth and childcare arrangements for our nearly six year old, which now favoured delivery at home.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"preparing-for-birth\">Preparing for birth</h2>\n\n<p>My boss had told me a few days prior that 'home births are great, because you can make a cup of tea'.</p>\n\n<p>So, I stocked up on tea bags, and prepared myself mentally and physically for the big day by repeatedly ignoring my wife's pleas to listen to her hypnobirthing mp3s on the expected role of the 'birthing partner' (whatever that is), and getting through the last of my beer stockpile in anticipation of several years of enforced sobriety (in order to deal with nighttime and next morning emergencies).</p>\n\n<p>I'm just thankful we never got around to implementing my boss's idea for a work appraisal, because his multi-tasking expectations are clearly way beyond my capabilities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"labour-of-birth\">Labour of birth</h2>\n\n<p>While I fully accept that I had the easiest job on the night (bar my nearly six year old, who thankfully slept through it all in the adjacent bedroom), I was very pleased the main bit was over relatively quickly (three hours) as my right arm and hand were getting tired.</p>\n\n<p>To ease the pain of contractions, and in the absence of any pain relief other than 'gas and air', my wife insisted (on pain of death) that I massage her lower back for two minutes every three minutes.</p>\n\n<p>In between massages/contractions, I had to top up her glass of filtered water and hold it to her lips for her to drink.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"birth\">Birth</h2>\n\n<p>When the baby's head came out, slowly, I remember thinking it was weirdly like watching a picture coming out of a printer.</p>\n\n<p>When he was out, I immediately noticed his testicles seemed abnormally large, the size of giant tea bags. (Turns out they were swollen with fluid.)</p>\n\n<p>'He's a boy, he's definitely a boy!' I said.</p>\n\n<p>I could have done with some gas and air myself at this point.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"after-birth\">After birth</h2>\n\n<p>My wife has been pretty amazing through it all. I don't know how she copes with the lack of sleep, although I'm doing my best to make sure she gets a couple of hours whenever she can when she's not busy feeding baby.</p>\n\n<p>I have done a few nappy changes. Son no. 1 is always delighted whenever his little brother pees all over me, which was really his main reason for wanting a little brother in the first place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lockdown-lock-in\">Lockdown/Lock-in</h2>\n\n<p>We're mainly homebirds, so the lockdown/lock-in has not been too bad for us. And we're lucky to have had everything we needed, including toilet paper, flour, use of our communal garden and area where we live for <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dvdmrsdn/104075799837748528\" rel=\"nofollow\">exercise</a>, sunshine, unusually fresh air, and seeing red kites and egrets flying over, among other lesser spotted wildlife.</p>\n\n<p>My eldest lad has suffered the most, as he misses his school routine and friends, which is compounded by his not realising that he would no longer be the centre of attention now his little brother is here.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Last night I arranged to meet a beautiful young woman and we spent an hour together alone in a dingy bedsit.</p>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, I reported a crime. A broken window in an empty first floor flat, a couple of empty cans of Stella Artois in a small black plastic carrier bag, and a toilet bowlful of urine – the water tank had been drained and capped weeks ago, so there was no running water with which to flush away the evidence, or remove the stench. I know this because I work for the landlord.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, after several answerphone messages, crossed wires and missed opportunities in the previous fortnight, Sam from forensics called me and asked me to meet her at the scene in ten minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Half an hour later, in the freezing cold, she arrived, alone, in a small van and armed only with a large suitcase. I wondered about offering to carry it for her, as she was quite small, but thought better of it.</p>\n\n<p>I took Sam up the flight of steps to the disused bedsit, and apologised for the diligence and speed with which our Caretaking and Repairs teams had disturbed the scene of the crime and replaced the broken window without telling me. I had deliberately not reported the broken window to avoid such a scenario.</p>\n\n<p>Sam opened her case and spread out on the floor her clipboard, forms, torch, evidence bags, swabs and other items of detection. She began writing and soon filled up half a page of notes. I apologised for generating so much paperwork for her and joked that she appeared to have even more to do than me. Finally, Sam got down to the nitty gritty. She put on her gloves and took the two empty cans of Stella Artois from the small, black plastic carrier bag and placed them strategically on the floor, several inches apart. She took out a carefully wrapped cotton bud swab, squeezed out some special liquid from a small bottle on to the bud and began rubbing the bud all around the top of the can, paying special attention to the opening and inside the hole. She then placed the swab inside a fresh evidence bag, sealed and signed it. More note taking. I wanted to ask what she was doing, just to break the intense silence, but thought better of it.</p>\n\n<p>Sam wrote another page of notes before examining the now repaired window. She asked me to hold the net curtains up as she couldn't reach, while she dusted the pane for prints. 'Just rub a little bit of washing up liquid on to it to get it off,' she said.</p>\n\n<p>'Thanks. I think I'll leave the washing up until later, though. So what are the chances of finding whodunnit?'</p>\n\n<p>'We'll probably find out who it was. But whether they'll be charged with anything is another matter. They've not done any damage. Probably just looking for somewhere to sleep.'</p>\n\n<p>'Yes. I was kind of hoping you wouldn't find anyone. I feel quite sorry for them. Only two cans of Stella. Although it's premium beer. Quality over quantity, I suppose. It's a shame there are so many empty properties here.'</p>\n\n<p>'Yes, that's the real crime. It makes me really angry. I just wish we had some politicians who listened and did something. But I don't have much hope that anything will ever change.'</p>\n\n<p>Sam gathered up her things and put them back into her suitcase, which she'd been using as a small bench to sit on.' Right, I'm done,' she said, and switched off her torch.</p>\n\n<p>In the gloom, I noticed a square of material on the dirty floor. 'Is this yours?' I turned it over. It was some kind of advertising leaflet. 'Candlelit Dinner For Two,' I heard myself say out loud.</p>\n\n<p>As we left, I thought about asking Sam why she didn't take a sample of the urine, but thought better of it.</p>\n",

As a result of Norman&rsquo;s niceness and despite me failing to safely land any aircraft due to my two frozen shoulders, Tim decided that I was capable of work after all, and told me so. And although Tim recognised that I have an illness or disability, he wasn&rsquo;t going to send me any more money to live on unless I appealed, actively started looking for work, or appealed.</p>\n<p>All of this made me feel rather like a terrible burden on society and that society might be just a whole lot better off without me around dragging it down. And I had been feeling really pretty suboptimal anyway.</p>\n<p>So I went back to my doctor, who signed me off sick again and gave me some anti-depressants and painkillers, and decided that of the three options given to me - appeal, look for work, or appeal - I would like to appeal. Tim wrote back straight away saying that he would send me some more money to live on as long as I send him my sick notes from my doctor. Seems fair enough.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s quite a difficult juggling act. On the one hand trying to get better, to get well again. On the other, remaining ill enough to be eligible for handouts. The last few months I&rsquo;ve been rapidly deteriorating, hitting a new low, barely able to speak to anyone even online. Most of the time, I simply don&rsquo;t feel like I have anything to say.</p>\n<p>That said, I have some good days, and I have now almost completed my assessments for psychotherapy and expect to start in a group sometime in the new year.

As a result of Norman's niceness and despite me failing to safely land any aircraft due to my two frozen shoulders, Tim decided that I was capable of work after all, and told me so. And although Tim recognised that I have an illness or disability, he wasn't going to send me any more money to live on unless I appealed, actively started looking for work, or appealed. \n\n\n\n\nAll of this made me feel rather like a terrible burden on society and that society might be just a whole lot better off without me around dragging it down. And I had been feeling really pretty suboptimal anyway. \n\n\n\n\nSo I went back to my doctor, who signed me off sick again and gave me some anti-depressants and painkillers, and decided that of the three options given to me - appeal, look for work, or appeal - I would like to appeal. Tim wrote back straight away saying that he would send me some more money to live on as long as I send him my sick notes from my doctor. Seems fair enough.\n\n\n\n\nIt's quite a difficult juggling act. On the one hand trying to get better, to get well again. On the other, remaining ill enough to be eligible for handouts. The last few months I've been rapidly deteriorating, hitting a new low, barely able to speak to anyone even online. Most of the time, I simply don't feel like I have anything to say. \n\n\n\n\nThat said, I have some good days, and I have now almost completed my assessments for psychotherapy and expect to start in a group sometime in the new year. At my last session, the therapist said it seemed like I'd been depressed all my life, but only now (well, two years ago) asked for help. Thanks for validating my experience.\n\n\n\n\nI had a good day yesterday, a good morning, at least, and decided to put it to use. So I carefully crafted for you, my dear reader, a veritable Christmas cracker of a musical podcast. Perhaps a cracker that doesn't crack and contains no party hat or plastic toy, but only a lame joke, but a cracker nonetheless. \n\n\n\n\nAnd here, containing my best charidee radio DJ voice, it is:\n\n\n\n\nJust A Ride, Episode 1: Xmas Stocking Filler (29:15)\n\n\n<audio src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2024/jarxmas1.mp3\" controls=\"controls\" preload=\"metadata\"></audio>\n\n\n\n\nSorry, couldn't be arsed with show notes.

To call it a Festival is really a big overstatement. It&rsquo;s a few years since I went to a beer festival and it was most likely Up North in deepest, darkest Bury, Lancashire, or somewhere like that. Maybe they do them differently Down South, but this was a bit of a let down. One tiny little bar, like you might find in a marquee at a modern marketed music festival. One brand of German Bier - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulaner\">Paulaner</a> - and only two varieties: Munich and Weiss. The Weiss was off by the time I had been pushed and shoved forward by the ten deep bar queue. If you didn&rsquo;t fancy Paulaner Munich, you could have that old Bavarian favourite, Foster&rsquo;s.

It’s called Jimmy Carter and as you might expect it’s about… well… Jimmy Carter, the former US president. We didn’t set out to write a song about him particularly, it’s just that someone came out with the line “Jimmy Carter was a peanut farmer”, and it had to be put into song. After a quick trawl of his Wikipedia page we were turning up all sorts of gems. Such as Jimmy Carter is the cousin of Motown Records supremo Berry Gordy, he’s also won a Nobel Peace prize and even a Grammy award. Mad huh?</i></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><i>All those nuggets of trivia found their way into the lyrics. It was originally just the main riff but then other sections were written to make it a bit more interesting as a full song. It’s hard to know what to describe this as, it’s almost country blues, but somehow not. There’s a bit of harmonica thrown in there so watch out for that too. You can’t beat the old gob iron.</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>This is licensed under CC BY-SA because it’s our own original work.

Without wishing to go into too much detail and bore anyone with my personal troubles, I had been speaking with a psychotherapist since September 2009. After a few sessions, she expressed her concern that I might be &lsquo;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_II_disorder\" title=\"Wikipedia article on Bipolar II disorder\">bipolar II</a>&rsquo; and asked me to see my GP in order to get a referral to a psychiatrist for an assessment. I felt pretty shocked to hear this as I&rsquo;d never considered that I might have had any hypomanic episodes (let alone needed to see a shrink) even though that might have explained some of my problems.</p>\n<p>In tears, I told my GP what my psychotherapist had said, and thus I began my own pharmaceutical research into the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant#Therapeutic_efficacy\" title=\"Wikipedia article on the efficacy of anti-depressants\">effectiveness of anti-depressant medications</a> to give me some respite (my GP&rsquo;s word) from my heightened and unstable emotional state. My GP also referred me for a psychiatric assessment.</p>\n<p>Mightily relieved finally to have spoken to someone about my difficulties and for allowing myself to ask for help, I felt as high as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temptation_of_Christ#3._Mountain\" title=\"The Temptation of Christ on the mountain\">Jesus on the mountain for forty days and nights</a>. Looking back now, it&rsquo;s perhaps significant that my <a href=\"http://identi.ca\" title=\"identi.ca public timeline\">identi.ca</a> output during this time was the highest it&rsquo;s ever been (according to <a href=\"http://identi.ca/macno\" title=\"Michele on identi.ca\">Michele</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.macno.org/denticator\" title=\"Denticator - identi.ca user statistics\">Denticator</a> - unfortunately it only shows the last 12 months, so you will have to take my word on that).

				"content_text": "Abstract: Thankfully, there is no Part Two.\n\nTags: snowcock, nanowrimo, manflu, cheese, depression\n\nNote: probably none of the links work now.\n\n\n[I began 2010][1] by wishing everyone (except fascists) a Happy New Year and a promise to blog my reflections on the naughty decade in due course.\n\nWell, that will have to wait for another time, but here - thanks to my [identi.ca memory aid][2] - are my reflections on 2010.\n\nAfter recovering from [hiccups][3], [speaking in tongues][4], a [hangover][5] the size of every Xmas and New Year and forced communication with [O2's customer service drones][6], I went back to work and set about the urgent task of building a [snowwoman][7] in the front garden.\n\n![][8]\n\nThis was my equal opportunities response the the much celebrated [#SnowCock][9] (replete with massive snowballs) of Glossop erected by [Tim Dobson][10] and friends.\n\n[![The Glossop Snowcock][11]][12]\n\n## **Heaven snows he's miserable now**\n\nSnowwoman somehow ended up transgendering into #[SnowMorrissey][13] until he inevitably lost his head, prompting a [lyrical tribute][14] from the similarly all-white and undead [Andy C][15].\n\nJust as life imitates art, 'real' life inevitably imitates life online. Perceptively and spookily - leaving aside the evidence of my maniacal online rantings - [Andy C was concerned for my mental health][16].\n\nIf I'm honest, my most recent mental breakdown occurred somewhat earlier. Without wishing to go into too much detail and bore anyone with my personal troubles, I had been speaking with a psychotherapist since September 2009. After a few sessions, she expressed her concern that I might be '[bipolar II][17]' and asked me to see my GP in order to get a referral to a psychiatrist for an assessment. I felt pretty shocked to hear this as I'd never considered that I might have had any hypomanic episodes (let alone needed to see a shrink) even though that might have explained some of my problems.\n\nIn tears, I told my GP what my psychotherapist had said, and thus I began my own pharmaceutical research into the [effectiveness of anti-depressant medications][18] to give me some respite (my GP's word) from my heightened and unstable emotional state. My GP also referred me for a psychiatric assessment.\n\nMightily relieved finally to have spoken to someone about my difficulties and for allowing myself to ask for help, I felt as high as [Jesus on the mountain for forty days and nights][19]. Looking back now, it's perhaps significant that my [identi.ca][20] output during this time was the highest it's ever been (according to [Michele][21]'s [Denticator][22] - unfortunately it only shows the last 12 months, so you will have to take my word on that). Interestingly, my output last month, since I've been feeling better and like my 'normal' self was just as high if not higher:\n\n![][23]\n\nI also increased my [long-form blogging][24] output, with a serious intent to try to write more regularly and have some fun in doing so.

I wrote eight proper blog posts in those forty days and nights including:\n\n> A [rant][26] on authority and the War of Terror\n\n> A [tribute][27] to Manchester United and my Mum and Dad\n\n> A [reminiscence][28] piece I originally wrote in 1989 about my time stuck in a blizzard on Longs Peak, Colorado\n\n> An [Ubuntu fanboi article][29]\n\n> Another [reminiscence][30] piece, this time about a childhood incident\n\n> And a frankly [bizarre post][31] about a blue tit\n\nIt had taken me nine months to write my previous eight proper blog posts and almost five months to write the next eight.

I thought it was a bit odd, because I&rsquo;d seen the surgeon who operated on me only the previous day, but I went in anyway. I felt I could trust these people after they did such a great job of fixing my lung. Anyway, when I got there, they made me wait for an hour as usual, then a pretty young student doctor asked if I minded if she sat in on my appointment? How could I say no? I could barely speak with my tongue hanging out like that. So I just nodded and wiped the dribble from the side of my mouth hoping she hadn&rsquo;t noticed. When I got to see the consultant himself I thought it was a bit odd that he was wearing full Nazi regalia, but he seemed like a nice guy and to know his stuff.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t rush back to work&quot;, he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3GcKnxaR3Go/TirPK8duQ7I/AAAAAAAApns/sB2kCgrxRq0/s800/Mancow-Muller-Waterboarding-276x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bronchoscopy\" title=\"Bronchoscopy simulation\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Now, about this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy\" title=\"Bronchoscopy on Wikipedia\">bronchoscopy</a>. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m sure everything will be OK. I&rsquo;m 90% sure everything&rsquo;s fine. People say it tickles a little bit, but you&rsquo;ll have a sedative and some local anaesthetic that they put up your nose and on the back of your throat. That will make you cough, but it&rsquo;s really nothing to worry about.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>&lsquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rsquo; I told him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So this week I went in for my &lsquo;bronchoscopy&rsquo;. After waiting the requisite hour, I was hurried into the day surgery operating theatre by a pretty young nurse and ignored by the doctor. Another nurse made small talk with me to reassure me. I clambered on to the operating table so that I was sat upright with my legs outstretched. The second nurse put a bib on me to deal with my dribbling while the doctor chatted with his friend on his mobile.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Dr Heydrich,&rsquo; he said to me finally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Although I had been feeling relaxed, at this point I suddenly felt a twinge of anxiety.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to put some anaesthetic gel up your nose,&rsquo; he said, as he squirted anaesthetic gel up my nose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>The second nurse then stuffed a tube up my left nostril, saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s only oxygen.&rsquo;</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"banana-splat\">Banana splat</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CQ6Qb6vbufI/TirPCvomAvI/AAAAAAAApmI/AUmmoIzu0ks/s800/visor-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Visor\" title=\"Splatter protection\">\nI looked at her and she had donned what looked like a welder&rsquo;s visor. &lsquo;You look like you&rsquo;re about to do some welding,&rsquo; I said.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just to protect myself from any splatter,&rsquo; she replied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Another twinge.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;OK, open your mouth, please,&rsquo; barked Heydrich. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to spray some anaesthetic on the back of your throat. It tastes very strongly of bananas,&rsquo; he added, as he sprayed what tasted like banana flavoured liqueur on to the back of my throat, making me cough. &lsquo;Just a little bit more,&rsquo; he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>&lsquo;UURRRGGHHH!!!&rsquo; I splattered.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&lsquo;UURRRGGHHH!!! UURRRGGHHH!!!&rsquo; I repeated.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rsquo; said the second nurse, holding my head down with her hand. &lsquo;It makes you feel like there&rsquo;s a ball in your throat and you can&rsquo;t swallow.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>&lsquo;UURRRGGHHH!!! UURRRGGHHH!!!&rsquo; I repeated, desperately.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heydrich then took what I had thought was a stethoscope and zoomed towards me with the bright flashing end of it and shoved it up my right nostril.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>AARRRGGHHH!!!&quot; I said.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s try the other one,&quot; said Heydrich.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>They swapped the oxygen for the stethoscope, which then dropped out of my traumatised right nostril.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&lsquo;AARRRGGHHH!!!

				"content_text": "Abstract: Gagging for it.\nTags: waterboarding, NHS, bronchoscopy, torture, worklessness, Nazi, psychotherapy, banana, splat\n\nOn Another Planet this week: controversial new government plans to tackle ever increasing worklessness using [waterboarding](http://waterboarding.org/how-to \"Waterboarding how-to guide\").\n\nTechniques refined and perfected by secret military personnel known only by their codename 'Our Boys' are being piloted by the NHS in an effort to 'encourage and empower' people claiming statutory sick pay to return to work.\n\nOne persistent malingerer, who asked not to be identified, claimed that he was subjected to an horrific ordeal at the hands of his torturers and says he was tricked into believing he was just playing a game of 'doctors and nurses'.\n\n> 'I always liked playing doctors and nurses when I was a kid,' said Roger (not his real name).\n\nOver to Roger to tell the rest of his story.\n\n## Nazi\n\nI received a phone call from my local hospital telling me I had an appointment with the chest consultant I'd seen before. I thought it was a bit odd, because I'd seen the surgeon who operated on me only the previous day, but I went in anyway. I felt I could trust these people after they did such a great job of fixing my lung. Anyway, when I got there, they made me wait for an hour as usual, then a pretty young student doctor asked if I minded if she sat in on my appointment? How could I say no? I could barely speak with my tongue hanging out like that. So I just nodded and wiped the dribble from the side of my mouth hoping she hadn't noticed. When I got to see the consultant himself I thought it was a bit odd that he was wearing full Nazi regalia, but he seemed like a nice guy and to know his stuff.  \n\n---\n\n> 'Don't rush back to work\", he said.  \n\n---\n\n![Bronchoscopy](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3GcKnxaR3Go/TirPK8duQ7I/AAAAAAAApns/sB2kCgrxRq0/s800/Mancow-Muller-Waterboarding-276x300.jpg \"Bronchoscopy simulation\")\n\n> 'Now, about this [bronchoscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy \"Bronchoscopy on Wikipedia\"). Don't worry, I'm sure everything will be OK. I'm 90% sure everything's fine. People say it tickles a little bit, but you'll have a sedative and some local anaesthetic that they put up your nose and on the back of your throat. That will make you cough, but it's really nothing to worry about.'  \n\n---\n\n'Fine, I'll do it,' I told him.  \n\n---\nSo this week I went in for my 'bronchoscopy'. After waiting the requisite hour, I was hurried into the day surgery operating theatre by a pretty young nurse and ignored by the doctor. Another nurse made small talk with me to reassure me. I clambered on to the operating table so that I was sat upright with my legs outstretched. The second nurse put a bib on me to deal with my dribbling while the doctor chatted with his friend on his mobile.  \n\n---\n\n> 'Hi, I'm Dr Heydrich,' he said to me finally.  \n\n---\nAlthough I had been feeling relaxed, at this point I suddenly felt a twinge of anxiety.  \n\n---\n\n> 'I'm going to put some anaesthetic gel up your nose,' he said, as he squirted anaesthetic gel up my nose. \n\n---\n\nThe second nurse then stuffed a tube up my left nostril, saying, 'Don't worry, it's only oxygen.'  \n\n---\n\n## Banana splat \n\n![Visor](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CQ6Qb6vbufI/TirPCvomAvI/AAAAAAAApmI/AUmmoIzu0ks/s800/visor-300x300.jpg \"Splatter protection\")\nI looked at her and she had donned what looked like a welder's visor. 'You look like you're about to do some welding,' I said.  \n\n---\n\n> 'It's just to protect myself from any splatter,' she replied.  \n\n---\n\nAnother twinge.  \n\n---\n\n> 'OK, open your mouth, please,' barked Heydrich. 'I'm going to spray some anaesthetic on the back of your throat. It tastes very strongly of bananas,' he added, as he sprayed what tasted like banana flavoured liqueur on to the back of my throat, making me cough. 'Just a little bit more,' he said.  \n\n---\n\n'UURRRGGHHH!!!' I splattered.  \n\n---\n\n'UURRRGGHHH!!! UURRRGGHHH!!!' I repeated.\n\n---\n\n> 'It's OK,' said the second nurse, holding my head down with her hand. 'It makes you feel like there's a ball in your throat and you can't swallow.'  \n\n---\n'UURRRGGHHH!!! UURRRGGHHH!!!' I repeated, desperately.  \n\n---\n\n> Heydrich then took what I had thought was a stethoscope and zoomed towards me with the bright flashing end of it and shoved it up my right nostril.  \n\n---\n\nAARRRGGHHH!!!\" I said.  \n\n---\n\n> 'Let's try the other one,\" said Heydrich.  \n\n---\n\nThey swapped the oxygen for the stethoscope, which then dropped out of my traumatised right nostril.  \n\n---\n\n'AARRRGGHHH!!! AARRRGGHHH!!!' I repeated.  \n\n---\n\nThat hurt even more than the right one did. The second nurse (I don't know what the first nurse was doing, but she was there afterwards) then pushed something into my mouth, saying, 'Open your mouth and hold it with your teeth.' \n\n---\n\nHeydrich zoomed back into view. \n\n---\n\n> 'We'll try it through the mouth', he said, as he pushed the thick black fibre-optic tube down my throat.  \n\n---\n\n'UURRRGGHHH!!! UURRRGGHHH!!!'  \n\n---\n\nI tried to cough and splutter, but my throat was numb and I couldn't breathe. I felt like I was drowning.  \n\n---\n\n'UURRRGGHHH!!! AARRRGGHHH!!!'  \n\n---\n\nI panicked and pulled the tube out, gasping for breath.  \n\n---\n\n'I can't do it!' I cried, literally, tears rolling down my cheeks.  \n\n---\n'I can't do it.

She cared for me deeply and carefully, and I gazed upon her lovingly as the morphine (d)ripped through my veins. She checked me out and made sure that everything seemed to be in working order.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Sofia,&rsquo;  she said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to be looking after you tonight.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks to the morphine, I carried on smiling and Sofia carried on with her job of nursing me through my first night after my thoracotomy on the high dependency unit of the five star NHS hospital I was staying in.</p>\n<p>I had quite a good time despite drinking nothing but water the entire evening. We shared a few bottles together - Sofia would hand me an empty one, pull the covers around me and I would half-fill it and hand it back to her so she could measure and record, discard and disinfect. She checked my tubes and drains to make sure they weren&rsquo;t getting clogged up with &lsquo;cheese&rsquo; or any other unwanted dairy products. She made sure that my drains were working properly and that I was getting enough suction (stop it!). In the morning, she washed my back. My only regret is that half-way through the night somebody much more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->attractive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ill than me was trolleyed through and Sofia spent more time with him than she did with me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-good-swing\">A good swing</h2>\n<p>So, Sofia had taken over from Gilbert, a beautiful young Chinese-looking man who I woke up with after my general anaesthetic. Gilbert was every bit as diligent and caring as Sofia and I don&rsquo;t think this is just the drugs talking. I was amazed by the level of care I received throughout my stay, with one or two relatively minor exceptions, which I&rsquo;ll come to later. And it&rsquo;s not just because I was probably quite a good patient - I was calm, polite, not in any great pain or discomfort, doing well - eating, drinking, breathing, coughing and I had a &lsquo;good swing&rsquo;. Most of the other patients around me appeared to be quite a lot older than me and if not older then certainly in more pain or experiencing more problems after their operations. They were cared for with equal if not more time and attention as far as I could see and hear.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qOSdhwh6JjA/TirPEMs0d5I/AAAAAAAApmg/ZPNORqLDXHQ/s400/Stockings-450x600.jpg\" alt=\"All dressed up\" title=\"All dressed up\"></p>\n<p>Who else do I need to thank for treating me so well? On admission to the hospital at 7 am on Friday morning I was met by nurse Martin, who seemed more nervous than me, but who handed me over to the highly organised Lindsay. Lyndsay wasted no time in getting me half-naked on to the bed so that she could attach clips and cables to my chest and stomach to run an ECG. Then she made me strip completely and wear a flowery dress. To complete my humiliation, she had me walk down to the diagnostic testing department in full public view where I had an x-ray. When I got back she wanted me to wear some thigh-high stockings, too. How could I resist her helping hands to put them on for me? Thank you Lyndsay!</p>\n<p>Thanks also to Rick, the porter, for your sense of humour in wheeling me up and down and up and down again to the operating theatre where I&rsquo;m sure everyone had a good laugh at me in drag. No doubt the pictures are all over the internet by now. And thanks to Dorcas, the clinical nurse specialist who spoke to me on the phone before I went in to tell me how bad it was going to be and who greeted me in the hospital before the operation with her hands - literally a nice touch, and one repeated by Lyndsay, Rick, Gilbert and Sofia later. A quick, simple touch to the hand, the shoulder, arm or elbow is extremely reassuring I find. Thanks for your humanity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-cheese-factor\">The cheese factor</h2>\n<p>Pre-operation, I also spoke to several doctors/surgeons/registrars or whatever they call themselves. They may even have had first names, but somehow if they did those names haven&rsquo;t stuck. All I can really remember is being told that the operation would take 90-120 minutes rather than the 30-45 minutes I was expecting. This was due to the fact that they would be doing a conventional &rsquo;large&rsquo; incision of about 10 cm rather than the keyhole 2 cm cuts I&rsquo;d been told I was going to have. The change of <em>modus operandi</em> was because of the &lsquo;cheese&rsquo; factor - they needed to scrape the rind off the lung, not simply drain fluid. I signed the consent form. By this time they had me where they wanted me and I had resigned myself to my fate. What else could I do but submit? Yes, there&rsquo;s a risk with everything, but carrying on with a lung full of cheese didn&rsquo;t seem like a good bet.</p>\n<p>Finally, Rick got me into theatre again after an aborted first attempt because my blood results weren&rsquo;t back in time. This also meant a delay of an hour and a half, which didn&rsquo;t affect me too much. I was kind of in a semi-meditational state I reckon. Either that or just frozen with fear. Now it was the turn of the anaesthetists to do things to me. Thanks to Belton (not Ben Elton) for painlessly finding my veins first time and inserting the cannulas that would feed the juice to knock me out and sustain me with fluids. All I can remember is a bit of aimless chit-chat, breathing deeply into the gas mask that was placed over my face and&hellip;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chris-the-crafty-cockney\">Chris the Crafty Cockney</h2>\n<p>Less than two hours later I woke up on the high dependency unit with Gilbert looking after me. At some point I remember my surgeon coming round to tell me, quite madly in his Chris the Crafty Cockney way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re fixed!&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo; I said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>\n<p>After Gilbert and Sofia, I was handed over to Tara, who was a bundle of fun in our short time together. Tara couldn&rsquo;t wait to get rid of me, though, and pushed the wheelchair herself to get me on to the main ward so that she could go and have lunch or something. I had been looking forward to moving wards actually. The high dependency unit was a bit noisy and a bit dull and now I would have access to my belongings that I brought with me - mp3/video player, internet, email, phone, etc. But when I was shown to my room (it&rsquo;s on old private hospital bought by the NHS) I felt strangely disheartened and lonely. On the high dependency unit, Gilbert, Sofia and Tara were always within eyesight or earshot, but on the ward my new nurse Nas and everyone else was gone within seconds. I was still attached to two drains and my morphine drip, so I couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere. I felt as helpless as a baby.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7QZGvto9lSM/TirPQVlAtTI/AAAAAAAApo8/9Rhu8xWbfA8/s400/CIMG1240-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Rhubarb and custard, or, cold wet cardboard and yellow slop\" title=\"Rhubarb and custard, or, cold wet cardboard and yellow slop\"></p>\n<p>At least I was on the ward in time for the Manchester derby, the most important game since the last one. And my mum and step-dad John were visiting at 2pm. Lunch was forgettable - one of my few complaints is that the food was largely very poor quality. As I discovered on my discharge from the hospital, there is a very good coffee bar and staff/visitors&rsquo; restaurant in the hospital, which I believe is managed by the same company that provides the patients&rsquo; meals, yet the comparison is dreadful. I didn&rsquo;t have much of an appetite due to the morphine, but it doesn&rsquo;t help when you are served up slop that is worse than school meals of thirty-odd years ago.</p>\n<p>Back to the footy. My mum proudly explained that my brother would be texting her with news of any goals.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s great, Mum. But I&rsquo;m getting text updates from the BBC every few minutes on my internet tablet.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>BBC text updates on one of the most uneventful ninety minutes in the history of football aren&rsquo;t much fun, but sustained conversation more than my brother&rsquo;s updates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BLEEP!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Crikey, a text from my brother to my mother.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;15 seconds left. Scholes header. Game over.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My mum read the text out loud.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;What does that mean?&rsquo; she asked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh, christ.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;It means,&rsquo; explained ever-patient John, who is not a football fan:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;United have won the game with a last minute winner yet again.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Oh.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;What do you think it means?&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This remote victory barely raised a smile on my dry lips and hardly registered an increased pulse according to Nas when she took my blood pressure. It is surely my least celebrated United goal ever, although I did manage a laugh and a cheer the next morning watching the highlight on Match of the Day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ufa0VZFK20Q/UDLEGv9BUeI/AAAAAAAAtDo/JNpvEg1v6bg/s400/Me_20and_20Jim.jpg\" alt=\"Reverend Jim Ignatowski and Shameless Frank Gallagher\" title=\"Reverend Jim Ignatowski and Shameless Frank Gallagher\"></p>\n<p>Sunday I had three separate visitors morning, afternoon and evening and I suspect I was fairly grumpy/tired during at least one of those, so apologies certainly to my dad. I have to say, though, that visits are extremely tiring and quite emotional. It&rsquo;s no wonder hospitals advise no more than two visitors at a time. And when you&rsquo;re in that state of post-op pain or discomfort, lack of mobility, tiredness, feeling sick etc., you&rsquo;re really not much company. It&rsquo;s great to see people, of course, but as a visitor you can&rsquo;t expect too much from your relative or friend. And thanks, dad, for leaving me with the advice to get a hair cut and a shave so that I don&rsquo;t look so much like Frank Gallagher!</p>\n<p>A quick thanks also at this point to some more lovely nurses - Sarah, Yvonne, Nadia, Esther - sorry if I missed anyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"minor-complaints\">Minor complaints</h2>\n<p>I mentioned earlier a couple of minor exceptions to the high level of care I received while in hospital.</p>\n<p>One would be that the cannula on my wrist became loose, swollen red and painful. I asked one of the nurses about it and she said it was ok and bandaged it up (after dropping the bandage on the floor!) to hold it in place. Later another nurse came to use the cannula to inject my antibiotics. Now this can usually feel a little uncomfortable, but nothing more than that. This time I was screaming in agony. I pointed out the problem again and she said that it was &lsquo;unacceptable&rsquo;, removed the cannula, patched me up and fixed the cannula in my hand so that it could be used for both the morphine drip and the antibiotics, painlessly.</p>\n<p>My second minor complaint would be that the same nurse who dropped the bandage came in gloved-up to remove my second drain, then went out again touching the door handle to call for assistance (two nurses are required - one to pull the drain out, one to tie the stitch, the painful bit). I asked her to change her gloves, which she did so willingly and acknowledging that she should do so. The point is that she should be taking the initiative not waiting for patients to prompt her. It&rsquo;s fairly basic stuff.</p>\n<p>My only other quibble is that I was discharged on Tuesday morning (four days after my op), barely able to walk more than a few yards without getting out of breath so basically forced to book a taxi home. They gave me some paracetamol, ibuprofen and dihydrocodeine for the pain, but for three out of the five days I&rsquo;ve been home so far that hasn&rsquo;t been enough to control the pain. It&rsquo;s really been quite distressing for me and for my family to see me in so much pain and to be able to do nothing to help. I&rsquo;m seeing my GP on Monday so maybe I&rsquo;ll get some extra help with that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-drugs-didnt-work\">The drugs didn&rsquo;t work</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how long it&rsquo;s going to take for me to recover and go back to working full-time. As far as I know, I&rsquo;m expected to make a full recovery, although I was a more than a little perturbed to read that post-op pain from a thoracotomy can take months or even years to go away.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure how this all happened. In January I had a chest infection and pleuritic pain similar to that which I&rsquo;d had in March 2009 when I had a really acute episode of shortness of breath, fever and a consolidation on the same lung. That cleared up quickly with antibiotics and an inhaler. This time around, the drugs didn&rsquo;t work, so my body responded by sealing off the infection in my lung by surrounding the lung with fluid.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I tried to work through this in February, which left me feeling too exhausted to go get an x-ray right away. Once I got the x-ray I was admitted to Accident and Emergency immediately where they did some tests to rule out heart problems, I think, before sending me home. Then I had to wait five weeks before seeing a chest specialist and another week or two before getting the results of fluid samples and a CT scan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hard-cheese\">Hard cheese</h2>\n<p>As luck would have it, all of these tests were negative (ruling out the likes of cancer and smoking as possible causes, as far as I know). But the build up of fluid had continued and I had progressively felt more and more physically and mentally tired. My surgeon was certain that I had what is known as empyema (the hard &lsquo;cheese&rsquo; as he called it and that I talked about earlier) and this required decortication (scraping the rind off the lung) via a thoracotomy (an incision along the underside of the shoulder blade).</p>\n<p>As it turned out, I was told that the scraping bit wasn&rsquo;t required, which is great news as that would likely have damaged the tissues of the lung. I&rsquo;ll be seeing my surgeon again in a week or two I think and the chest specialist next month. I&rsquo;ve been told it&rsquo;s still possible that I could have tuberculosis, although there is no evidence of that yet (it takes a while to show up apparently). Meanwhile I&rsquo;m taking antibiotics for pneumonia - if I don&rsquo;t breathe deeply and cough well enough I&rsquo;m at risk of getting a chest infection. And, despite the lovely nurses, I don&rsquo;t want to go there again!</p>\n",

By this time they had me where they wanted me and I had resigned myself to my fate. What else could I do but submit? Yes, there's a risk with everything, but carrying on with a lung full of cheese didn't seem like a good bet.\n\nFinally, Rick got me into theatre again after an aborted first attempt because my blood results weren't back in time. This also meant a delay of an hour and a half, which didn't affect me too much. I was kind of in a semi-meditational state I reckon. Either that or just frozen with fear. Now it was the turn of the anaesthetists to do things to me. Thanks to Belton (not Ben Elton) for painlessly finding my veins first time and inserting the cannulas that would feed the juice to knock me out and sustain me with fluids. All I can remember is a bit of aimless chit-chat, breathing deeply into the gas mask that was placed over my face and....\n\n## Chris the Crafty Cockney\n\nLess than two hours later I woke up on the high dependency unit with Gilbert looking after me. At some point I remember my surgeon coming round to tell me, quite madly in his Chris the Crafty Cockney way:  \n\n> 'You're fixed!'  \n\n---\n\n> 'Thank you!' I said.  \n\nThank you, thank you, thank you!  \n\nAfter Gilbert and Sofia, I was handed over to Tara, who was a bundle of fun in our short time together. Tara couldn't wait to get rid of me, though, and pushed the wheelchair herself to get me on to the main ward so that she could go and have lunch or something. I had been looking forward to moving wards actually. The high dependency unit was a bit noisy and a bit dull and now I would have access to my belongings that I brought with me - mp3/video player, internet, email, phone, etc. But when I was shown to my room (it's on old private hospital bought by the NHS) I felt strangely disheartened and lonely. On the high dependency unit, Gilbert, Sofia and Tara were always within eyesight or earshot, but on the ward my new nurse Nas and everyone else was gone within seconds. I was still attached to two drains and my morphine drip, so I couldn't go anywhere. I felt as helpless as a baby.\n\n![Rhubarb and custard, or, cold wet cardboard and yellow slop][2]\n\nAt least I was on the ward in time for the Manchester derby, the most important game since the last one. And my mum and step-dad John were visiting at 2pm. Lunch was forgettable - one of my few complaints is that the food was largely very poor quality. As I discovered on my discharge from the hospital, there is a very good coffee bar and staff/visitors' restaurant in the hospital, which I believe is managed by the same company that provides the patients' meals, yet the comparison is dreadful. I didn't have much of an appetite due to the morphine, but it doesn't help when you are served up slop that is worse than school meals of thirty-odd years ago.\n\nBack to the footy. My mum proudly explained that my brother would be texting her with news of any goals.  \n\n> 'That's great, Mum. But I'm getting text updates from the BBC every few minutes on my internet tablet.'  \n\nBBC text updates on one of the most uneventful ninety minutes in the history of football aren't much fun, but sustained conversation more than my brother's updates. \n\n> BLEEP!  \n\nCrikey, a text from my brother to my mother. \n\n> '15 seconds left. Scholes header. Game over.'  \n\nMy mum read the text out loud.  \n\n> 'What does that mean?' she asked.  \n\nOh, christ.  \n\n> 'It means,' explained ever-patient John, who is not a football fan:  \n\n---\n\n> 'United have won the game with a last minute winner yet again.'  \n\n---\n\n> 'Oh.'  \n\n---\n\n> 'What do you think it means?'  \n\nThis remote victory barely raised a smile on my dry lips and hardly registered an increased pulse according to Nas when she took my blood pressure. It is surely my least celebrated United goal ever, although I did manage a laugh and a cheer the next morning watching the highlight on Match of the Day.  \n\n![Reverend Jim Ignatowski and Shameless Frank Gallagher][3]\n\nSunday I had three separate visitors morning, afternoon and evening and I suspect I was fairly grumpy/tired during at least one of those, so apologies certainly to my dad. I have to say, though, that visits are extremely tiring and quite emotional. It's no wonder hospitals advise no more than two visitors at a time. And when you're in that state of post-op pain or discomfort, lack of mobility, tiredness, feeling sick etc., you're really not much company. It's great to see people, of course, but as a visitor you can't expect too much from your relative or friend. And thanks, dad, for leaving me with the advice to get a hair cut and a shave so that I don't look so much like Frank Gallagher!\n\nA quick thanks also at this point to some more lovely nurses - Sarah, Yvonne, Nadia, Esther - sorry if I missed anyone.  \n\n## Minor complaints\n\nI mentioned earlier a couple of minor exceptions to the high level of care I received while in hospital. \n\nOne would be that the cannula on my wrist became loose, swollen red and painful. I asked one of the nurses about it and she said it was ok and bandaged it up (after dropping the bandage on the floor!) to hold it in place. Later another nurse came to use the cannula to inject my antibiotics. Now this can usually feel a little uncomfortable, but nothing more than that. This time I was screaming in agony. I pointed out the problem again and she said that it was 'unacceptable', removed the cannula, patched me up and fixed the cannula in my hand so that it could be used for both the morphine drip and the antibiotics, painlessly. \n\nMy second minor complaint would be that the same nurse who dropped the bandage came in gloved-up to remove my second drain, then went out again touching the door handle to call for assistance (two nurses are required - one to pull the drain out, one to tie the stitch, the painful bit). I asked her to change her gloves, which she did so willingly and acknowledging that she should do so. The point is that she should be taking the initiative not waiting for patients to prompt her. It's fairly basic stuff.\n\nMy only other quibble is that I was discharged on Tuesday morning (four days after my op), barely able to walk more than a few yards without getting out of breath so basically forced to book a taxi home. They gave me some paracetamol, ibuprofen and dihydrocodeine for the pain, but for three out of the five days I've been home so far that hasn't been enough to control the pain. It's really been quite distressing for me and for my family to see me in so much pain and to be able to do nothing to help. I'm seeing my GP on Monday so maybe I'll get some extra help with that.\n\n## The drugs didn't work\n\nI'm not sure how long it's going to take for me to recover and go back to working full-time. As far as I know, I'm expected to make a full recovery, although I was a more than a little perturbed to read that post-op pain from a thoracotomy can take months or even years to go away. \n\nI'm still not sure how this all happened. In January I had a chest infection and pleuritic pain similar to that which I'd had in March 2009 when I had a really acute episode of shortness of breath, fever and a consolidation on the same lung. That cleared up quickly with antibiotics and an inhaler. This time around, the drugs didn't work, so my body responded by sealing off the infection in my lung by surrounding the lung with fluid. \n\nUnfortunately I tried to work through this in February, which left me feeling too exhausted to go get an x-ray right away. Once I got the x-ray I was admitted to Accident and Emergency immediately where they did some tests to rule out heart problems, I think, before sending me home. Then I had to wait five weeks before seeing a chest specialist and another week or two before getting the results of fluid samples and a CT scan. \n\n## Hard cheese\n\nAs luck would have it, all of these tests were negative (ruling out the likes of cancer and smoking as possible causes, as far as I know). But the build up of fluid had continued and I had progressively felt more and more physically and mentally tired. My surgeon was certain that I had what is known as empyema (the hard 'cheese' as he called it and that I talked about earlier) and this required decortication (scraping the rind off the lung) via a thoracotomy (an incision along the underside of the shoulder blade). \n\nAs it turned out, I was told that the scraping bit wasn't required, which is great news as that would likely have damaged the tissues of the lung. I'll be seeing my surgeon again in a week or two I think and the chest specialist next month. I've been told it's still possible that I could have tuberculosis, although there is no evidence of that yet (it takes a while to show up apparently). Meanwhile I'm taking antibiotics for pneumonia - if I don't breathe deeply and cough well enough I'm at risk of getting a chest infection. And, despite the lovely nurses, I don't want to go there again!\n\n[1]: https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qOSdhwh6JjA/TirPEMs0d5I/AAAAAAAApmg/ZPNORqLDXHQ/s400/Stockings-450x600.jpg \"All dressed up\"\n[2]: https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7QZGvto9lSM/TirPQVlAtTI/AAAAAAAApo8/9Rhu8xWbfA8/s400/CIMG1240-600x450.jpg \"Rhubarb and custard, or, cold wet cardboard and yellow slop\"\n[3]: https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ufa0VZFK20Q/UDLEGv9BUeI/AAAAAAAAtDo/JNpvEg1v6bg/s400/Me_20and_20Jim.jpg \"Reverend Jim Ignatowski and Shameless Frank Gallagher\"\n",

Gerrard seems to be the notional left-sided midfielder now. Barry is the holding midfielder and he has played well for England in that role over the last two years since Steve McClaren put him there.

				"title": "Why we're crap: the problem with English football",
				"content_html": "<p>It’s often the case that what in one sense is an undeniable strength can at the same time also be a real or potential weakness. English football’s great history and tradition raises everyone’s expectations, yet the English football team must compete on an increasingly commercialised and sophisticated international playing field. We have more fans, more money and more foreigners in our game than any other country, so it’s no surprise that when things don’t go to plan, everyone feels quite upset and let down. And the media does its best to blame anyone and everyone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There’s such a lot at stake, now. It was only sixty years or so ago that the Football Association, which is now grieving over the financial loss of failure to qualify for Euro 2008 and stating that qualification for Euro and World Cup Finals is a minimum requirement of the team manager/coach, actively prevented the national team from taking part. It’s only forty years or so since we won it. As it happens, Sir Alf Ramsey, like Second Choice Steve McClaren also failed to qualify for his first Euro Finals in 1964…. We have a long history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world, so it’s not as if it’s anything new or that we should be surprised about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with English football has been documented in the press as being anything from too many foreign players, too much money, expectation of fans not matched with reality, players and coaches not good enough, not enough passion or care, too much passion and not enough technique, too much pressure and fear, too much drinking and not enough team spirit. The reality is probably that all of these factors are important to a lesser or greater degree. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too many foreign players<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Sven-Goran Erikkson points out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, managers often buy overseas players because they are cheaper on average than their English or British counterparts. That’s also why so few of our players play abroad - because there isn’t the money to pay them, not necessarily that they aren’t good enough. Beckham was and arguably still is good enough to play for Real Madrid. That’s why there are too many foreign players.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much money<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So part of the problem may be that the players get paid too much?

				"content_text": "It’s often the case that what in one sense is an undeniable strength can at the same time also be a real or potential weakness. English football’s great history and tradition raises everyone’s expectations, yet the English football team must compete on an increasingly commercialised and sophisticated international playing field. We have more fans, more money and more foreigners in our game than any other country, so it’s no surprise that when things don’t go to plan, everyone feels quite upset and let down. And the media does its best to blame anyone and everyone. <br /><br />There’s such a lot at stake, now. It was only sixty years or so ago that the Football Association, which is now grieving over the financial loss of failure to qualify for Euro 2008 and stating that qualification for Euro and World Cup Finals is a minimum requirement of the team manager/coach, actively prevented the national team from taking part. It’s only forty years or so since we won it. As it happens, Sir Alf Ramsey, like Second Choice Steve McClaren also failed to qualify for his first Euro Finals in 1964…. We have a long history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world, so it’s not as if it’s anything new or that we should be surprised about.<br /><br />The problem with English football has been documented in the press as being anything from too many foreign players, too much money, expectation of fans not matched with reality, players and coaches not good enough, not enough passion or care, too much passion and not enough technique, too much pressure and fear, too much drinking and not enough team spirit. The reality is probably that all of these factors are important to a lesser or greater degree. <br /><h4 id=\"too-many-foreign-players\">Too many foreign players</h4><a href=\"http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2216346,00.html\" title=\"I can get English players but they cost too much.\">As Sven-Goran Erikkson points out</a>, managers often buy overseas players because they are cheaper on average than their English or British counterparts. That’s also why so few of our players play abroad - because there isn’t the money to pay them, not necessarily that they aren’t good enough. Beckham was and arguably still is good enough to play for Real Madrid. That’s why there are too many foreign players.<br /><h4><b>Too much money</b></h4>So part of the problem may be that the players get paid too much? But that is not the players’ fault, just market forces, mainly to do with Sky TV money and, er, the FA, who contract with them for Premier League (the same FA which hijacked the Football League) and England rights. What this means is that the very best English players - who are on a par at least, with the very best players in the world - are paid significantly more. This is why Arsene Wenger has so few English players in his squad, not because they aren’t good enough, but because they are too expensive. <br /><h4>The new Scotland</h4>Maybe I’m wrong, but it seems to me that we are repeating what happened in Scotland during the Graeme Souness era at Rangers - he bought lots of foreigners in, Celtic and others later followed suit and <a href=\"https://almaxp.wordpress.com/2010/11/14/the-absolute-game-remembered-part-53/\" title=\"Graeme’s insistence on signing non-Scots has ultimately had a deleterious effect on the Scottish national team.\">the Scottish national team suffered as a result</a>. <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2006/04/a-new-scotland-why-englands-football.html\" title=\"A new Scotland\">I’m not the only one</a> who thinks that <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/my-schadenfreude-runs-dry-for-england-the-new-scotland-1.830913\" title=\"England are the new Scotland\">England are the new Scotland</a>.<br /><br />The recent Scottish revival has surely been due to Rangers and Celtic developing a core group of home-grown players to complement their foreign signings.

Really it's a sausage casserole (I looked at the back of a packet of Colman's casserole mix in Tesco for the ingredients and just left out the cancer-causing stuff - not that I'm feeling superior in any way as I'm sure I've eaten plenty of it in the past), but I like to call it:\n\n## Bangers 'n' Mash:\n\n- olive oil\n- chilli oil\n- garlic paste\n- herbs and spices: dried sage, parsley, oregano, - paprika, black pepper, sea salt\n- baby onions\n- green pepper\n- mushrooms\n- tinned, chopped plum tomatoes\n- instant onion gravy\n- tomato ketchup\n- cooked Lincolnshire sausages\n- potatoes\n- butter\n- milk\n\nThis is a nice way to use up some leftover sausages - you don't have to use Lincolnshire sausages, any will do, same with most of the ingredients. I just use what's available to me. This will make enough for four servings. \n\nGet a large pan for your peeled and, washed and finely chopped potatoes, adding a drop of olive oil and some sea salt and covering with water. Put it on a high heat until it comes to the boil, then simmer for fifteen to twenty minutes or until the potatoes are soft enough to mash easily. \n\nAssuming you have some pre-cooked sausages and you've prepared all the veg, heat up your wok or large frying pan, add a good shake of olive oil, chilli oil to suit your taste and a little butter to stop the oil from burning. When it's hot, add a teaspoon of garlic paste, a shake of the herbs and spices followed quickly by the onions, peppers and mushrooms and stir-fry on a high heat for a few minutes.\n\nThe longer you do it, the softer and smaller the peppers and mushrooms will be, so do it as you like it. Add the tomatoes, make up half a pint of instant onion gravy and stir it in. Add a teaspoon of ketchup (or use lemon juice, vinegar and sugar) and the pre-cooked sausages.\n\nLeave to simmer for at least twenty minutes. When the potatoes are ready, drain and mash with a dollop of butter and a little milk. \n\nServe.\n\nLike most foods, it will taste even better the following night re-heated.\n",
