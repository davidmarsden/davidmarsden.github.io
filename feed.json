He sneaked in, sat at the back mostly unseen by anyone there, and then left early.</p>\n\n<p>A bit like his time as an MP!</p>\n\n<p>So, at this meeting.</p>\n\n<p>We discovered that Asian and African people, the majority of people in Southall, are genetically more at risk from poisoning from naphthalene.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma have to say about that?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>For two years or more, Southallians have complained to Mr Sharma about the oppressive stink, and poison air, coming from the old gasworks site. I have suffered numerous chest infections, my wife had serious and severe health problems, and my young son has been hospitalised with asthma and now has to take steroids every day of his life so that he can breathe. I know neighbours whose loved ones have now got cancer, and some who have died from cancer. All, we believe, caused by the poison air.</p>\n\n<p>What has Mr Sharma done to help us?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, a group of us presented Mr Sharma with a petition signed by 900 Southallians and their families and friends begging Mr Sharma to do something to get Berkeley Group, the developer of the old gasworks site, to stop poisoning Southall.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma do?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, throughout the last couple of years, while his constituents in Southall Green have been poisoned by the toxic air from the old gasworks site, and getting ill with breathing problems, and cancer, the developer Berkeley Group has sponsored numerous local events, mainly to 'clean up' Southall.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma do?</p>\n\n<p>He attended every one and was photographed smiling broadly wearing his hi-viz jacket with the Berkeley Group logo emblazoned across it.</p>\n\n<p>So tonight, I'm voting in favour of the trigger ballot for Mr Sharma, so that we have the opportunity to have a new Labour MP for Ealing Southall, one who will stand up for local people rather than help those who oppress them.</p>\n\n<p>And I ask all of you to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Solidarity!</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Sharma was triggered for reselection, but survived without having to stand again thanks to his old pal Boris Johnson, who called a general election shortly after.</p>\n",

Ever!</p>\n\n<p>Ealing Council Leader Julian Bell publicly blamed 'the wrong kind of wind', and ‚Äì quite possibly ‚Äì privately blamed 'fucking moaners'. All the while racking up over ¬£30,000 in declared gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group, who were digging up the gasworks land.</p>\n\n<p>Our soon-to-be local ward councillor and (ex-)Head of Planning Peter Mason knew all about the dangers (he tells us on Twitter) from the contaminated land back in 2009 when he campaigned against its development along with our MP Virendra Sharma (who said the development would be 'a disaster environmentally').</p>\n\n<p>Yet no one told people living nearby to expect to be gassed in our own homes and gardens during the three month heatwave that was shortly to arrive.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Ealing Council announced on Twitter that the odours, while 'unpleasant', were 'not harmful to health' would be 'gone in a few days'.</p>\n\n<p>I later discovered that there is scientific evidence that some people with Asian and African heritages are genetically more vulnerable to very serious and sometimes fatal health conditions from inhaling naphthalene, a fact acknowledged (although later denied, despite the published evidence) by Public Health England at a packed public meeting in July 2019.</p>\n\n<p>No one told us.</p>\n\n<p>Ealing Council, despite being fully aware of the potential dangers to health (and to the environment) failed to carry out any kind of Equalities Impact Assessment, and only helped Berkeley Group to rush through the decontamination process to maximise their profit from Crossrail in Southall.</p>\n\n<p>Profit over people. Labour Council. Our lives didn't matter to them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we are being asked to believe that our MP (who has begun making the right noises two years too late ‚Äì what happened to the nearly 1,000 signature petition I gave you in 2018 Mr Sharma?) cares and is on our side, and that our local ward councillor cares and always has done. Only Bell is ‚Äì unusually for him ‚Äì honest enough not to suddenly pretend he gives a shit about anyone but himself and looking after his own family.</p>\n\n<p>At the packed public meeting in 2019, which our local ward councillor chaired, he and Bell refused to declare their financial interests with Berkeley Group, refused to let me speak with the microphone so that people couldn't hear that the Council, Berkeley Group, the Environment Agency and Public Health England had all colluded to cover up the real level of toxic and carcinogenic air pollution ‚Äì that it was consistently above legal limits and rising ‚Äì by manipulating, removing, and presenting the air quality data in such a way as to make it look like it was mostly within legal limits.</p>\n\n<p>At the same meeting, our MP arrived late, mostly unseen, sat silently at the back of the room, and left early, mostly unseen.\nAt the same meeting, a strangely truthful Bell admitted that he had 'known about the nuisance, the BAD nuisance, for two and a half years'! Yet nothing could be done.</p>\n\n<p>Now Peter Mason, free from his constraints as Head of Planning after resigning following his failed coup attempt to take the leadership from Bell last year, is telling us that something could and should have been done, yet all of them remained silent and did nothing for years.</p>\n\n<p>Unbelievable!</p>\n",

After a night felling too hot and too cold, Monday morning I had a temperature of 38.3¬∞C.</p>\n\n<p>I went to my local walk-through testing clinic later that afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>It was a self-test. If I'd known, I would have ordered a test-at-home kit, although I wouldn't have got my result as quick.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn't do the throat swab as it made me want to throw up.

The testing marquee itself, for all the hand gel, seems like as good a place as any to catch covid.</p>\n\n<p>In eleven months, I've been out to the supermarket maybe three times, the pharmacy the same, to the park occasionally. During the summer, we visited my mother-in-law after she had recovered from covid.</p>\n\n<p>I took my six year old to and from school every day up until the Christmas holidays, and that is the last direct contact any of us as a family have had with other human beings.</p>\n\n<p>‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢</p>\n\n<p>So, it's a bit of a mystery how I caught the infection.

Practising prudent use of valuable PPE supplies, the midwives wore their own prescription spectacles to protect from splashes to the eyes. <em>(This is, of course, not true. They had NHS supplied aprons, surgical masks, and gloves.)</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"home-delivery\">Home delivery</h2>\n\n<p>Now, we've had our groceries, pizza and most other household and personal items delivered to our home, rather than dealing with the stress of actually going out and having to interact with other people, for years, so a home delivery of our new son might have seemed like an obvious choice.</p>\n\n<p>But a home birth was definitely Plan B, and only came to be Plan A due to coronavirus related issues with hospital birth and childcare arrangements for our nearly six year old, which now favoured delivery at home.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"preparing-for-birth\">Preparing for birth</h2>\n\n<p>My boss had told me a few days prior that 'home births are great, because you can make a cup of tea'.</p>\n\n<p>So, I stocked up on tea bags, and prepared myself mentally and physically for the big day by repeatedly ignoring my wife's pleas to listen to her hypnobirthing mp3s on the expected role of the 'birthing partner' (whatever that is), and getting through the last of my beer stockpile in anticipation of several years of enforced sobriety (in order to deal with nighttime and next morning emergencies).</p>\n\n<p>I'm just thankful we never got around to implementing my boss's idea for a work appraisal, because his multi-tasking expectations are clearly way beyond my capabilities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"labour-of-birth\">Labour of birth</h2>\n\n<p>While I fully accept that I had the easiest job on the night (bar my nearly six year old, who thankfully slept through it all in the adjacent bedroom), I was very pleased the main bit was over relatively quickly (three hours) as my right arm and hand were getting tired.</p>\n\n<p>To ease the pain of contractions, and in the absence of any pain relief other than 'gas and air', my wife insisted (on pain of death) that I massage her lower back for two minutes every three minutes.</p>\n\n<p>In between massages/contractions, I had to top up her glass of filtered water and hold it to her lips for her to drink.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"birth\">Birth</h2>\n\n<p>When the baby's head came out, slowly, I remember thinking it was weirdly like watching a picture coming out of a printer.</p>\n\n<p>When he was out, I immediately noticed his testicles seemed abnormally large, the size of giant tea bags. (Turns out they were swollen with fluid.)</p>\n\n<p>'He's a boy, he's definitely a boy!' I said.</p>\n\n<p>I could have done with some gas and air myself at this point.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"after-birth\">After birth</h2>\n\n<p>My wife has been pretty amazing through it all. I don't know how she copes with the lack of sleep, although I'm doing my best to make sure she gets a couple of hours whenever she can when she's not busy feeding baby.</p>\n\n<p>I have done a few nappy changes. Son no. 1 is always delighted whenever his little brother pees all over me, which was really his main reason for wanting a little brother in the first place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lockdown-lock-in\">Lockdown/Lock-in</h2>\n\n<p>We're mainly homebirds, so the lockdown/lock-in has not been too bad for us. And we're lucky to have had everything we needed, including toilet paper, flour, use of our communal garden and area where we live for <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dvdmrsdn/104075799837748528\" rel=\"nofollow\">exercise</a>, sunshine, unusually fresh air, and seeing red kites and egrets flying over, among other lesser spotted wildlife.</p>\n\n<p>My eldest lad has suffered the most, as he misses his school routine and friends, which is compounded by his not realising that he would no longer be the centre of attention now his little brother is here.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Six years ago <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wondered<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if the lack of Englishmen in Arsenal‚Äôs team (and most of the other leading Premier League teams) would herald a new era of Scotland-like failure for the England football team? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, thanks in part to Arsene Wenger‚Äôs penchant for Saintly youth team players (Theo, The Ox), we‚Äôre not quite there, yet, although undercover Scotsman Steve McClaren successfully tried and failed to qualify for Euro 2008.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mediocre<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But perhaps that also explains why there are now six players (Kelly, Johnson, Henderson, Downing, Carroll - and it‚Äôs debatable whether any of them would get into the current Scotland team - plus captain Gerrard) from a mid-table, mediocre Liverpool squad in the current England set-up?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Five years ago I blogged about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the problem with English football<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - how our ‚Äòlong history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world‚Äô perversely raises mainstream media expectations for the national side upon the start of any tournament for which we qualify. (Of course, I realise that they can hardly expect to win the ratings war and/or advertising revenue by informing potential viewers that it‚Äôs not likely to be New Improved England, but more Same Old England, if we‚Äôre lucky. Especially not when we need all the distraction we can get from the grim reality of how useless and fucked up our country is right now.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Failures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Had Gareth Barry not picked up an injury and had to withdraw from the current squad, England would almost certainly be starting Euro 2012 against France with the same successful central midfield system that ‚ÄòJocky‚Äô McClaren stumbled upon - Gerrard and Barry - just prior to his tactically innovative use of an umbrella as cover in the pissing rain and then being sacked and publicly humiliated for his efforts (which, statistically, were on a par with Sir Bobby Robson‚Äôs, and mirrored Sir Alf Ramsey‚Äôs and Robson‚Äôs failures to qualify for their first tournaments in charge). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two years ago I successfully predicted (admittedly, not hard to do) that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->England didn‚Äôt have a hope in hell of winning the World Cup in South Africa<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The good news this time around is that Joe Hart is in goal and that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äòlumbering hulk of long-ball fodder who couldn‚Äôt score a goal even if you put it in front of him and offered him ¬£50,000 a week‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, also known as Emile Heskey, is not even on the standby list (although Andy Carroll does look like a handy replacement).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Left at home<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bad news is that the only English defender we have who has actually proved himself in tournament football, Rio Ferdinand, has been left at home by Old Mother Hodgson because he is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scorpio<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our defence, therefore, is likely to be the same as that which kept out the mighty Algeria, and the smallest nation at the finals two years ago, Slovenia, but with Phil Jagielka or Joleon Lescott replacing former England captain Ferdinand (who of course, was himself replaced before the tournament began due to injury by the injury-prone Ledley King, who of course, was himself replaced due to injury in the first game by Jamie Carragher, who of course, was himself replaced in the third game due to being crap by, er, Stoke bench-warmer Matthew Upson) alongside racist philanderer, and former England captain (twice over) John Terry.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As good a defence, in effect, as that which went on to concede four goals to a proper team, Germany.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Failures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moving on to the midfield (if we can keep possession of the football for long enough) it looks like England will be starting with the same creative talents as in South Africa, bar the injured Barry and Lampard, who will be replaced by the injured Parker and Gerrard. Milner or Walcott (for footballing reasons, presumably) are likely to come in for Aaron Lennon on the right, with Stewart Downing (for footballing reasons‚Ä¶ oh, wait) taking over from Milner/Gerrard on the left. Despite my longing for Downing to score the winning goal in a penalty shoot-out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the final against the Germans<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this midfield quartet cannot in any way be described as an improvement on 2010‚Äôs fiasco, or even 2008‚Äôs failures.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up front, of course, England will have to play proper teams France and Sweden without Wayne Rooney, our one truly world class player. By the time he‚Äôs eligible to play in England‚Äôs final group game against the co-hosts Ukraine, England are quite likely to be needing a win to have any hope of even qualifying for the quarter-finals.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thoroughly outplayed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->England‚Äôs two warm-up games have followed a similar pattern to those in 2010, although perhaps offering a glimmer of hope where two years ago there really was none. In 2010, England were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äòthoroughly outplayed at Wembley by Mexico, only winning by virtue of having taller players, and then, in Austria, thoroughly outplayed by the equally diminutive Japan, only winning by virtue of two fortuitous own goals‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

				"content_text": "Six years ago <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2006/04/a-new-scotland-why-englands-football.html\">I wondered</a> if the lack of Englishmen in Arsenal‚Äôs team (and most of the other leading Premier League teams) would herald a new era of Scotland-like failure for the England football team? <br /><br />Well, thanks in part to Arsene Wenger‚Äôs penchant for Saintly youth team players (Theo, The Ox), we‚Äôre not quite there, yet, although undercover Scotsman Steve McClaren successfully tried and failed to qualify for Euro 2008.<br /><h4>Mediocre</h4>But perhaps that also explains why there are now six players (Kelly, Johnson, Henderson, Downing, Carroll - and it‚Äôs debatable whether any of them would get into the current Scotland team - plus captain Gerrard) from a mid-table, mediocre Liverpool squad in the current England set-up?<br /><br />Five years ago I blogged about <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-were-crap-problem-with-english.html\">the problem with English football</a> - how our ‚Äòlong history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world‚Äô perversely raises mainstream media expectations for the national side upon the start of any tournament for which we qualify. (Of course, I realise that they can hardly expect to win the ratings war and/or advertising revenue by informing potential viewers that it‚Äôs not likely to be New Improved England, but more Same Old England, if we‚Äôre lucky. Especially not when we need all the distraction we can get from the grim reality of how useless and fucked up our country is right now.)<br /><h4 id=\"failures\">Failures</h4>Had Gareth Barry not picked up an injury and had to withdraw from the current squad, England would almost certainly be starting Euro 2012 against France with the same successful central midfield system that ‚ÄòJocky‚Äô McClaren stumbled upon - Gerrard and Barry - just prior to his tactically innovative use of an umbrella as cover in the pissing rain and then being sacked and publicly humiliated for his efforts (which, statistically, were on a par with Sir Bobby Robson‚Äôs, and mirrored Sir Alf Ramsey‚Äôs and Robson‚Äôs failures to qualify for their first tournaments in charge). <br /><br />Two years ago I successfully predicted (admittedly, not hard to do) that <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/02/why-england-dont-have-hope-in-hell-of.html\">England didn‚Äôt have a hope in hell of winning the World Cup in South Africa</a>. The good news this time around is that Joe Hart is in goal and that the <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/05/no-future-in-englands-dreaming-inside.html\">‚Äòlumbering hulk of long-ball fodder who couldn‚Äôt score a goal even if you put it in front of him and offered him ¬£50,000 a week‚Äô</a>, also known as Emile Heskey, is not even on the standby list (although Andy Carroll does look like a handy replacement).<br /><h4>Left at home</h4>The bad news is that the only English defender we have who has actually proved himself in tournament football, Rio Ferdinand, has been left at home by Old Mother Hodgson because he is a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/the-game-plan-from-out-of-this-world-zodiac-signs-help-domenech-spot-his-shooting-stars-800471.html\" title=\"Or for footballing reasons. Or whatever.\">Scorpio</a>. <br /><br />Our defence, therefore, is likely to be the same as that which kept out the mighty Algeria, and the smallest nation at the finals two years ago, Slovenia, but with Phil Jagielka or Joleon Lescott replacing former England captain Ferdinand (who of course, was himself replaced before the tournament began due to injury by the injury-prone Ledley King, who of course, was himself replaced due to injury in the first game by Jamie Carragher, who of course, was himself replaced in the third game due to being crap by, er, Stoke bench-warmer Matthew Upson) alongside racist philanderer, and former England captain (twice over) John Terry.<br /><br />As good a defence, in effect, as that which went on to concede four goals to a proper team, Germany.<br /><h4 id=\"failures-1\">Failures</h4>Moving on to the midfield (if we can keep possession of the football for long enough) it looks like England will be starting with the same creative talents as in South Africa, bar the injured Barry and Lampard, who will be replaced by the injured Parker and Gerrard. Milner or Walcott (for footballing reasons, presumably) are likely to come in for Aaron Lennon on the right, with Stewart Downing (for footballing reasons‚Ä¶ oh, wait) taking over from Milner/Gerrard on the left. Despite my longing for Downing to score the winning goal in a penalty shoot-out <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/06/the-world-cup-on-drugs-pure-grade.html\">in the final against the Germans</a>, this midfield quartet cannot in any way be described as an improvement on 2010‚Äôs fiasco, or even 2008‚Äôs failures.<br /><br />Up front, of course, England will have to play proper teams France and Sweden without Wayne Rooney, our one truly world class player. By the time he‚Äôs eligible to play in England‚Äôs final group game against the co-hosts Ukraine, England are quite likely to be needing a win to have any hope of even qualifying for the quarter-finals.<br /><h4>Thoroughly outplayed</h4>England‚Äôs two warm-up games have followed a similar pattern to those in 2010, although perhaps offering a glimmer of hope where two years ago there really was none. In 2010, England were <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/05/no-future-in-englands-dreaming-inside.html\">‚Äòthoroughly outplayed at Wembley by Mexico, only winning by virtue of having taller players, and then, in Austria, thoroughly outplayed by the equally diminutive Japan, only winning by virtue of two fortuitous own goals‚Äô</a>. In 2012, England were thoroughly outplayed in Norway, only winning by virtue of a sublime piece of skill from Ashley Young, and then, at Wembley, thoroughly outplayed by Belgium, only winning by virtue of a sublime piece of skill from Danny Welbeck.<br /><h4>Humiliation</h4>I suspect that England‚Äôs tournament will pan out in equally inglorious fashion, beginning with defeat at the feet of the French, put to the sword in a dire draw by the Swedes, and ignominious exit in the rain against Ukraine. To cope with the likely onset of boredom, depression and homicidal rage, I recommend following the same principles as in my guide to <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/06/the-world-cup-on-drugs-pure-grade.html\">The World Cup on drugs</a>.<br /><br />And if England‚Äôs special brand of austerity football means avoiding the pain of humiliation against Spain in the quarter-finals, then it‚Äôs surely all for the greater good.\n",

Terry playing like he has his pants down around his ankles half the time. Replacements (based on Capello‚Äôs selections so far) would be Brown, Lescott, Upson and Baines (since the useless Bridge has withdrawn). Other possibilities for left back from the squad might include Barry or Milner. Slightly more left of field, literally as well as metaphorically, would be Warnock and Phil Neville.</li></ul><ul><li>I‚Äôm not convinced by our midfield or our formation and tactics playing two wide players and two central midfielders. Lennon is injured, Walcott is recovering from injury. Beckham is fit only for 15 minute cameos. So, Milner looks like he will start on the right and has shown lots of energy and drive. Gerrard seems to be the notional left-sided midfielder now. Barry is the holding midfielder and he has played well for England in that role over the last two years since Steve McClaren put him there. But he looks a shadow of that player now. Lampard is our ‚Äòcreative‚Äô attacking midfielder. The same player who can disappear for an entire 90 minutes despite his massive size.</li></ul><ul><li>Although we have one of the best centre forwards in the world in Wayne Rooney, Capello seems to insist on pairing him with one of the worst centre forwards in the world in Emile Heskey. Sorry, but likeable as Emile is - and he tries, I know he tries - he is not up to it. If we are to play with two up front then I‚Äôd stick Gerrard in there.

				"title": "Why we're crap: the problem with English football",
				"content_html": "<p>It‚Äôs often the case that what in one sense is an undeniable strength can at the same time also be a real or potential weakness. English football‚Äôs great history and tradition raises everyone‚Äôs expectations, yet the English football team must compete on an increasingly commercialised and sophisticated international playing field. We have more fans, more money and more foreigners in our game than any other country, so it‚Äôs no surprise that when things don‚Äôt go to plan, everyone feels quite upset and let down. And the media does its best to blame anyone and everyone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There‚Äôs such a lot at stake, now. It was only sixty years or so ago that the Football Association, which is now grieving over the financial loss of failure to qualify for Euro 2008 and stating that qualification for Euro and World Cup Finals is a minimum requirement of the team manager/coach, actively prevented the national team from taking part. It‚Äôs only forty years or so since we won it. As it happens, Sir Alf Ramsey, like Second Choice Steve McClaren also failed to qualify for his first Euro Finals in 1964‚Ä¶. We have a long history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world, so it‚Äôs not as if it‚Äôs anything new or that we should be surprised about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with English football has been documented in the press as being anything from too many foreign players, too much money, expectation of fans not matched with reality, players and coaches not good enough, not enough passion or care, too much passion and not enough technique, too much pressure and fear, too much drinking and not enough team spirit. The reality is probably that all of these factors are important to a lesser or greater degree. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too many foreign players<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Sven-Goran Erikkson points out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, managers often buy overseas players because they are cheaper on average than their English or British counterparts. That‚Äôs also why so few of our players play abroad - because there isn‚Äôt the money to pay them, not necessarily that they aren‚Äôt good enough. Beckham was and arguably still is good enough to play for Real Madrid. That‚Äôs why there are too many foreign players.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much money<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So part of the problem may be that the players get paid too much? But that is not the players‚Äô fault, just market forces, mainly to do with Sky TV money and, er, the FA, who contract with them for Premier League (the same FA which hijacked the Football League) and England rights. What this means is that the very best English players - who are on a par at least, with the very best players in the world - are paid significantly more. This is why Arsene Wenger has so few English players in his squad, not because they aren‚Äôt good enough, but because they are too expensive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The new Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but it seems to me that we are repeating what happened in Scotland during the Graeme Souness era at Rangers - he bought lots of foreigners in, Celtic and others later followed suit and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Scottish national team suffered as a result<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôm not the only one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who thinks that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->England are the new Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The recent Scottish revival has surely been due to Rangers and Celtic developing a core group of home-grown players to complement their foreign signings. And I‚Äôm sure that a lot of their England based players can‚Äôt wait to get a game for Scotland after watching too many games from the stand or playing for less successful clubs!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overpaid English players<!-- raw HTML omitted -->At club level, Arsenal are successful in part at least because they have a salary structure which prevents them buying overpaid English players, but keeps team spirit up - see how much better they are doing without the overpaid Henry! Same with United to a different extent. Fergie‚Äôs discipline is what he buys by paying top wages and Ince, Kanchelskis, Beckham, Van Nistelrooy and Keane are all examples of players who reached their sell-by dates, for the team‚Äôs eventual benefit. Chelsea pay everyone top wages, of course, while my guess is that the likes of Liverpool, Newcastle, Spurs and any other under-achievers get the balance wrong between wages and value.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much pressure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there‚Äôs more to it than that. Michael Owen says that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the players can‚Äôt cope with the pressure of playing for England now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not that they don‚Äôt care. Although at some point we have to admit that other teams are sometimes better than us, that would certainly explain some lacklustre performances and results. Where does the pressure come from? The fans? The media?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My opinion is that the fans want England to win, or - if they can‚Äôt win - to play well, trying.

				"content_text": "It‚Äôs often the case that what in one sense is an undeniable strength can at the same time also be a real or potential weakness. English football‚Äôs great history and tradition raises everyone‚Äôs expectations, yet the English football team must compete on an increasingly commercialised and sophisticated international playing field. We have more fans, more money and more foreigners in our game than any other country, so it‚Äôs no surprise that when things don‚Äôt go to plan, everyone feels quite upset and let down. And the media does its best to blame anyone and everyone. <br /><br />There‚Äôs such a lot at stake, now. It was only sixty years or so ago that the Football Association, which is now grieving over the financial loss of failure to qualify for Euro 2008 and stating that qualification for Euro and World Cup Finals is a minimum requirement of the team manager/coach, actively prevented the national team from taking part. It‚Äôs only forty years or so since we won it. As it happens, Sir Alf Ramsey, like Second Choice Steve McClaren also failed to qualify for his first Euro Finals in 1964‚Ä¶. We have a long history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world, so it‚Äôs not as if it‚Äôs anything new or that we should be surprised about.<br /><br />The problem with English football has been documented in the press as being anything from too many foreign players, too much money, expectation of fans not matched with reality, players and coaches not good enough, not enough passion or care, too much passion and not enough technique, too much pressure and fear, too much drinking and not enough team spirit. The reality is probably that all of these factors are important to a lesser or greater degree. <br /><h4 id=\"too-many-foreign-players\">Too many foreign players</h4><a href=\"http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2216346,00.html\" title=\"I can get English players but they cost too much.\">As Sven-Goran Erikkson points out</a>, managers often buy overseas players because they are cheaper on average than their English or British counterparts. That‚Äôs also why so few of our players play abroad - because there isn‚Äôt the money to pay them, not necessarily that they aren‚Äôt good enough. Beckham was and arguably still is good enough to play for Real Madrid. That‚Äôs why there are too many foreign players.<br /><h4><b>Too much money</b></h4>So part of the problem may be that the players get paid too much? But that is not the players‚Äô fault, just market forces, mainly to do with Sky TV money and, er, the FA, who contract with them for Premier League (the same FA which hijacked the Football League) and England rights. What this means is that the very best English players - who are on a par at least, with the very best players in the world - are paid significantly more. This is why Arsene Wenger has so few English players in his squad, not because they aren‚Äôt good enough, but because they are too expensive. <br /><h4>The new Scotland</h4>Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but it seems to me that we are repeating what happened in Scotland during the Graeme Souness era at Rangers - he bought lots of foreigners in, Celtic and others later followed suit and <a href=\"https://almaxp.wordpress.com/2010/11/14/the-absolute-game-remembered-part-53/\" title=\"Graeme‚Äôs insistence on signing non-Scots has ultimately had a deleterious effect on the Scottish national team.\">the Scottish national team suffered as a result</a>. <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2006/04/a-new-scotland-why-englands-football.html\" title=\"A new Scotland\">I‚Äôm not the only one</a> who thinks that <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/my-schadenfreude-runs-dry-for-england-the-new-scotland-1.830913\" title=\"England are the new Scotland\">England are the new Scotland</a>.<br /><br />The recent Scottish revival has surely been due to Rangers and Celtic developing a core group of home-grown players to complement their foreign signings. And I‚Äôm sure that a lot of their England based players can‚Äôt wait to get a game for Scotland after watching too many games from the stand or playing for less successful clubs!<br /><h4 id=\"overpaid-english-players\">Overpaid English players</h4>At club level, Arsenal are successful in part at least because they have a salary structure which prevents them buying overpaid English players, but keeps team spirit up - see how much better they are doing without the overpaid Henry! Same with United to a different extent. Fergie‚Äôs discipline is what he buys by paying top wages and Ince, Kanchelskis, Beckham, Van Nistelrooy and Keane are all examples of players who reached their sell-by dates, for the team‚Äôs eventual benefit. Chelsea pay everyone top wages, of course, while my guess is that the likes of Liverpool, Newcastle, Spurs and any other under-achievers get the balance wrong between wages and value.<br /><h4>Too much pressure</h4>But there‚Äôs more to it than that. Michael Owen says that <a href=\"http://www.jarrowandhebburngazette.com/sport/we-can-t-cope-with-pressure-owen-1-1283821\" title=\"We can't cope with pressure - Owen\">the players can‚Äôt cope with the pressure of playing for England now</a>, not that they don‚Äôt care. Although at some point we have to admit that other teams are sometimes better than us, that would certainly explain some lacklustre performances and results. Where does the pressure come from? The fans? The media?<br /><br />My opinion is that the fans want England to win, or - if they can‚Äôt win - to play well, trying. The media just want to sell stories, and their marketing strategy is the time-honoured sensationalism of even the most mundane non-news (Steve McClaren under an umbrella. OK, so he looked a bit daft, but, if he kept dry and we‚Äôd won‚Ä¶). <br /><br />So, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7103110.stm\" title=\"England 2-3 Croatia\">we lost to Croatia</a>. What we should all have been saying was congratulations to Croatia on a deserved victory and let‚Äôs support McClaren in  rebuilding for real this time instead of picking on every little thing and waiting for him to fail. Things looked good against Russia and Israel, he stumbled across a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù (Gerrard and Barry) that worked. He was unlucky with injuries, but should have been given longer.\n",
