My next goal came four years later, by which time I had moved back into the midfield and defence. Still, it was a scorcher from 30 yards. Worth waiting for once scored two own goals in the first half of a game. One was a delicate chip into the far top corner of the goal from the edge of my own area giving my keeper no chance. The second was a diving header. I was substituted at half time and my replacement scored an own goal of his own with his first touch, a splendid 35 yard strike out of nowhere. As captain of the team I once substituted myself so that I didn't get beaten up afterwards. The team's manager once asked me if our best player, who was being disciplined for fighting, should play in the cup semi-final against far and away the best team in Lincolnshire. said, you want us to have any chance of winning, then yes!'

				"title": "Funny old game",
				"content_html": "<p>In the good old days, football was a simple game. You had eleven players and a substitute numbered 1 to 12, no shirt advertising, a referee and two linesmen, a manager, a trainer, a physio, a scout or two, tea ladies, drinking culture, long hair and perms, the club chairman, a board of directors, a club secretary, a groundsman, a stadium in the beating heart of the town or city, fans, standing room only, electric atmospheres, matches on Saturday at three o&rsquo;clock, live coverage on the radio, match reports in the Pink Final after the game, and highlights on Match of the Day at 10:30 the same night. Tradition and history.</p>\n<p>These days, it&rsquo;s big business. You&rsquo;ve got a hundred players in the first team squad, shirt number bingo sponsored by online sports betting companies, the reserves, the academy, a women&rsquo;s team, out on loan, transfer windows, exiled due to poor man-management, five, seven, nine subs to choose from, a referee and a substitute referee, assistant refs, refs sat in an office in a business park (a clear and obvious error), refs at home, refs in the studio, refs in the crowd, a manager, a head coach, a goalkeeping coach, various other specialist coaches, multitudes of doctors, physios, psychologists, data analysts, worldwide scouting networks, dieticians, head chefs, gambling addictions, agents, chief executives, directors of football, technical directors, presidents of business, heads of legal, heads of state, matches at any time from noon to after the last train home, an advertiser&rsquo;s stadium out of town, sitting room only, live streaming all day and all night. Profit and sustainability.</p>\n<p>At one time, a manager of a football club could expect to run all aspects of the club to a lesser or greater degree, or at least have a major say in how it was run. Nowadays, managers, or coaches, are often restricted to, well, coaching players in training and on match days, and speaking to the media before and after games. They are seen as specialists rather than all-rounders, and more specialists from the world of corporate finance are brought in to fire the tea ladies and keep the manager - sorry, coach - fully focused on his job and not get distracted by wheeling and dealing in the transfer market, player contracts, or appealing points deductions for spending beyond the club&rsquo;s means.</p>\n<h1 id=\"united\">United</h1>\n<p>Indeed, this is how United plc&rsquo;s Dan Ashworth keeps Eric ten Hag successful on the pitch. Oh, wait. I&rsquo;m no fan in particular of Jamie Carragher, but he might have had a point when described United last season as one of the most poorly coached sides in the Premier League. United&rsquo;s usual set up is a chaotic mismatch of players out of form, out of position, out of confidence, and out of luck. Individual errors rule the day, and most of the players look lost and like they&rsquo;d rather be in the physio room or gambling rehab. We rely totally on one player - Bruno - to create chances and score. This is a colossal failure of recruitment, of management, of coaching, of captaincy, of teamwork.</p>\n<p>Fergie took six seasons to win the title after twenty six years of hurt, and three seasons after winning the cup in 1990. His team often looked like it wasn&rsquo;t making any progress, but the cup win did see a consistent marked improvement season on season (13th to 6th to 2nd to 1st). Ten Hag produced a masterful cup win against all the odds, although perhaps City&rsquo;s players were caught off guard expecting an easy win after United&rsquo;s lucky semi-final win against Coventry. Every season Pep has them playing in a clearly identifiable system and is never afraid to switch players or tactics.</p>\n<h1 id=\"ingerland\">Ingerland</h1>\n<p>It&rsquo;s funny to hear Morgan Gibbs-White talk about Ingerland&rsquo;s new interim manager Lee Carsley and describe his qualities as basically being a father-figure. Most top-level professional footballers are with their clubs from the age of eight, and likely spend more time than most kids away from their families and any normal childhood - living the dream, nonetheless. You can understand why they would value this kind of man-management, someone who will stick up for them no matter what.</p>\n<p>Ten Hag hasn&rsquo;t got that about him at all.

				"content_text": "In the good old days, football was a simple game. You had eleven players and a substitute numbered 1 to 12, no shirt advertising, a referee and two linesmen, a manager, a trainer, a physio, a scout or two, tea ladies, drinking culture, long hair and perms, the club chairman, a board of directors, a club secretary, a groundsman, a stadium in the beating heart of the town or city, fans, standing room only, electric atmospheres, matches on Saturday at three o'clock, live coverage on the radio, match reports in the Pink Final after the game, and highlights on Match of the Day at 10:30 the same night. Tradition and history.\n\nThese days, it's big business. You've got a hundred players in the first team squad, shirt number bingo sponsored by online sports betting companies, the reserves, the academy, a women's team, out on loan, transfer windows, exiled due to poor man-management, five, seven, nine subs to choose from, a referee and a substitute referee, assistant refs, refs sat in an office in a business park (a clear and obvious error), refs at home, refs in the studio, refs in the crowd, a manager, a head coach, a goalkeeping coach, various other specialist coaches, multitudes of doctors, physios, psychologists, data analysts, worldwide scouting networks, dieticians, head chefs, gambling addictions, agents, chief executives, directors of football, technical directors, presidents of business, heads of legal, heads of state, matches at any time from noon to after the last train home, an advertiser's stadium out of town, sitting room only, live streaming all day and all night. Profit and sustainability.\n\nAt one time, a manager of a football club could expect to run all aspects of the club to a lesser or greater degree, or at least have a major say in how it was run. Nowadays, managers, or coaches, are often restricted to, well, coaching players in training and on match days, and speaking to the media before and after games. They are seen as specialists rather than all-rounders, and more specialists from the world of corporate finance are brought in to fire the tea ladies and keep the manager - sorry, coach - fully focused on his job and not get distracted by wheeling and dealing in the transfer market, player contracts, or appealing points deductions for spending beyond the club's means.\n\n# United\n\nIndeed, this is how United plc's Dan Ashworth keeps Eric ten Hag successful on the pitch. Oh, wait. I'm no fan in particular of Jamie Carragher, but he might have had a point when described United last season as one of the most poorly coached sides in the Premier League. United's usual set up is a chaotic mismatch of players out of form, out of position, out of confidence, and out of luck. Individual errors rule the day, and most of the players look lost and like they'd rather be in the physio room or gambling rehab. We rely totally on one player - Bruno - to create chances and score. This is a colossal failure of recruitment, of management, of coaching, of captaincy, of teamwork.\n\nFergie took six seasons to win the title after twenty six years of hurt, and three seasons after winning the cup in 1990. His team often looked like it wasn't making any progress, but the cup win did see a consistent marked improvement season on season (13th to 6th to 2nd to 1st). Ten Hag produced a masterful cup win against all the odds, although perhaps City's players were caught off guard expecting an easy win after United's lucky semi-final win against Coventry. Every season Pep has them playing in a clearly identifiable system and is never afraid to switch players or tactics. \n\n# Ingerland \n\nIt's funny to hear Morgan Gibbs-White talk about Ingerland's new interim manager Lee Carsley and describe his qualities as basically being a father-figure. Most top-level professional footballers are with their clubs from the age of eight, and likely spend more time than most kids away from their families and any normal childhood - living the dream, nonetheless. You can understand why they would value this kind of man-management, someone who will stick up for them no matter what.\n\nTen Hag hasn't got that about him at all. He's lost a whole load of players in one way or another because he didn't have the heart or the head or the guts to stand by them when they needed him. De Gea, Maguire, Wan Bissaka, Casemiro, McTominay, Sancho, Antony, Martial, Rashford, Greenwood. \n\nThe spineless corporate bosses meanwhile took an age to decide the safest bet was to keep ten Hag. Failure is expected and gives them half a season at least to bed themselves in and some new players, too, in time for a new manager. If he does well, then they made the right decision. If they had appointed a new manager he might have failed, too, with the current players, and that would have reflected badly on the corporate bosses.\n\nAt least we're not Chelsea. Telling your captain that he's not technically good enough. Successfully scraping through the play-off round of the Conference League. Moneyball gone mad (although they could have a decent team in three seasons...).\n",

The US is, of course, founded by religious extremists fleeing persecution in their homelands, and who then inflicted genocide on the native American peoples as they colonised and settled on their lands. It&rsquo;s a white European, male supremacist culture, very similar to Zionism, so it&rsquo;s really no wonder the two are inextricably allied.</p>\n",

Anyway, for some reason I can't remember, this professor ended up explaining to me just how fearful, and loathing, and downright paranoid he was about unAmericans who - in his words - were \"all out to get us\".\n\nI didn't really understand it then, I was just left gobsmacked that anyone could really feel like that in the richest and most powerful country in the world. But on the other hand, I knew that most of the Americans I had met had never travelled beyond their state borders, and never learned anything of the world outside of the US, and mostly were solely concerned with getting their degrees while having one massive keg party. A surprising (to me) number of female students were already married (or engaged to be married), and all wore so much make-up on a daily basis it's like they were auditioning for Real Housewives sixteen years before it aired on TV.\n\nThe Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza and a recent [quote from a Jewish man born and raised into Zionist culture](https://davidmarsden.info/2024/05/09/zionism-is-rooted.html) made me think about my paranoid professor and his [culturally repressed students and the American people more generally](https://davidmarsden.info/1989/11/09/multicultural-societies.html), as it is the United States of America that is paying for and arming Israel. The US is, of course, founded by religious extremists fleeing persecution in their homelands, and who then inflicted genocide on the native American peoples as they colonised and settled on their lands. It's a white European, male supremacist culture, very similar to Zionism, so it's really no wonder the two are inextricably allied.\n",

It was a very second hand Mini Cooper, which ultimately failed its MoT when the <em>papier mâché</em> the previous careful owner had used to fill the side panel caught fire while the mechanic was welding something (it&rsquo;s a long time ago, and I never understood how cars work, partly thanks to my Physics teacher, who told all the boys to leave his class on &ldquo;how cars work&rdquo; because, obviously, being boys, we already knew).</p>\n<p>Anyway, the farmer kindly gave us a lift home. On the way, he told us he would deduct the petrol money (£5 each) from our wages. Now in those days, £5 was quite a lot of money, certainly enough to get royally drunk on at the weekend and still have enough for a bag of chips from the Chinese takeaway afterwards.</p>\n<p>I also worked some summers in the plastics factory my mum worked at. She, and the other local mums made children&rsquo;s play clothes, while the local children put poles into windbreaks to make sitting on the local beaches bearable in the face of the North Sea winds.</p>\n<p>I came to the conclusion that there must be something wrong with me, and so I decided to go to University to study psychology and find a fix.</p>\n<p>In order to get into Uni, I needed a better &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level result than me three Es from school, so I did a correspondence course in Law and got a B. I could have gone to Manchester Polytechnic, but instead elected to go to Bolton Institute of Higher Education. I was really too terrified to go to Manchester Poly (too big, too big city centre). Christ, I was even terrified of getting on the train (not knowing how or where to buy a ticket, how to know which train to get on, how to know when to get off, etc.).</p>\n<p>Manchester appealed because it was where my dad hailed from (well, Oldham, really, although he went to school in Manchester, and, of course, went to Old Trafford to watch Best, Law and Charlton in their heyday).</p>\n<p>Bolton was interesting and fun, though, and I made some good friends there, got a 2:1 degree, spent a year in the US on an exchange programme where I did several road trips across the country, climbed a mountain, nearly died in a blizzard, skied down other mountains, made no. 26 on the University Soccer Team, among other things.</p>\n<p>In my first semester in the states, I was terribly homesick and made an unscheduled visit home for Christmas and New Year. When I went back, I got into the experience so much I wanted to stay, but couldn&rsquo;t get a job or visa to do so.</p>\n<p>When I finished my degree, I was hopelessly lost again with know idea what to do. My degree had taught me (wrongly, imo) that psychological problems were contained wholly within the individual person and could be treated by taking lots of drugs (not that I was against that, at all). My careers advisor helpfully counselled that I could do anything I wanted to do as long as it wasn&rsquo;t psychology (for which I&rsquo;d need a medical degree). I half-heartedly applied to do a Masters degree, but the thought of more constrained studying wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted (I wanted money to buy drugs).</p>\n<p>So, with friends, I got a summer job with an employment agency picking orders in an old cotton mill converted into a warehouse in Shaw. We supplemented the permanent staff, who could mostly be found sleeping in dens hidden inside a maze of boxes, and so had to work twice as hard for a fraction of the pay without any benefits of regular employment like sick pay, holidays, etc. Or in our case, as it turned out, no pay at all, at least until I led a delegation of workers to confront the hapless recruitment agent.</p>\n<p>I quit that job, and looked around for work. I remember going to an interview in leafy Stockport (or maybe it was Wilmslow) or somewhere &ldquo;down south&rdquo; for some kind of &ldquo;trainee manager&rdquo; job. There were a lot them about at the time. While I was waiting to go in, I saw and heard all the staff gather for what appeared to be their regular morning meeting, where they began chanting some bizarre marketing cult bullshit. I made my excuses and ran for my life.</p>\n<p>I signed up, instead, as a &ldquo;trainee manager&rdquo; for Domino&rsquo;s Pizza at their franchise in Swinton. I lasted six weeks, although it felt like longer. I worked 80 hour weeks for £80 a week and all the leftover pizza I could eat. My <em>nadir</em> was a Saturday night when I found myself left alone in charge of the shop and unable to cope. I was never the fastest at making the fast food. In those days, Domino&rsquo;s promised to deliver within 40 minutes of your order or you get it for free. Once I got behind, it was impossible to catch up. On this night I swear people were phoning their friends saying, &ldquo;Free pizza at Domino&rsquo;s! It&rsquo;ll be stone cold when you get it, but hey!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>My dad threatened to get me job in the pea processing plant where he was now a supervisor back in Grimsby, and while I ended up moving back with him I worked in a high street burger bar called <em>Yankees</em> (I called it <em>Wankers</em>) instead. Why? I don&rsquo;t know, because I was clearly unsuited to the frenetic, frantic pace of the work, and dealing with drunken customers in the early hours of a Saturday or Sunday morning. I remember chasing a group of youths down the street with a carving knife after they squirted ketchup all over my nice clean shop walls.</p>\n<p>Along with my best friend at Uni, I applied for a job at Manchester University as a Research Assistant. I was terrible at interviews then, while he breezed it. I was absolutely gutted, and couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Then, out of the blue a few weeks later, my mate called me to tell me they had a job for me. So back I went. I spent three years researching nothing at all, but thoroughly enjoying living the life in Manchester city centre, with all that entailed, in the early 90s.</p>\n",

We supplemented the permanent staff, who could mostly be found sleeping in dens hidden inside a maze of boxes, and so had to work twice as hard for a fraction of the pay without any benefits of regular employment like sick pay, holidays, etc. Or in our case, as it turned out, no pay at all, at least until I led a delegation of workers to confront the hapless recruitment agent.\n\nI quit that job, and looked around for work. I remember going to an interview in leafy Stockport (or maybe it was Wilmslow) or somewhere \"down south\" for some kind of \"trainee manager\" job. There were a lot them about at the time. While I was waiting to go in, I saw and heard all the staff gather for what appeared to be their regular morning meeting, where they began chanting some bizarre marketing cult bullshit. I made my excuses and ran for my life.\n\nI signed up, instead, as a \"trainee manager\" for Domino's Pizza at their franchise in Swinton. I lasted six weeks, although it felt like longer. I worked 80 hour weeks for £80 a week and all the leftover pizza I could eat. My *nadir* was a Saturday night when I found myself left alone in charge of the shop and unable to cope. I was never the fastest at making the fast food. In those days, Domino's promised to deliver within 40 minutes of your order or you get it for free. Once I got behind, it was impossible to catch up. On this night I swear people were phoning their friends saying, \"Free pizza at Domino's! It'll be stone cold when you get it, but hey!\"\n\nMy dad threatened to get me job in the pea processing plant where he was now a supervisor back in Grimsby, and while I ended up moving back with him I worked in a high street burger bar called *Yankees* (I called it *Wankers*) instead. Why? I don't know, because I was clearly unsuited to the frenetic, frantic pace of the work, and dealing with drunken customers in the early hours of a Saturday or Sunday morning. I remember chasing a group of youths down the street with a carving knife after they squirted ketchup all over my nice clean shop walls.\n\nAlong with my best friend at Uni, I applied for a job at Manchester University as a Research Assistant. I was terrible at interviews then, while he breezed it. I was absolutely gutted, and couldn't believe it. Then, out of the blue a few weeks later, my mate called me to tell me they had a job for me. So back I went. I spent three years researching nothing at all, but thoroughly enjoying living the life in Manchester city centre, with all that entailed, in the early 90s. \n",

				"content_text": "Frank was my great grandfather on my dad's side.\n\nI only met him a couple of times. One time, me and my brother were made to wear the most ridiculous and embarrassing outfits, and we just felt very uncomfortable and ill-at-ease meeting this very old man from another time.\n\nHe was born in the early 1901. So he must have been 80 or so when we met him. Not so old these days, but back then he really was like a dinosaur, or a fossil.\n\nI remember a couple of stories about him. After the Great War, when he was a young man with a new wife and baby daughter (my grandmother), he had to walk twenty-five miles to work, where he would labour hard for sixteen hours before walking home again, only to be brutally murdered by his father before going to bed and getting up the next morning to do the same thing over and over again. Well, he certainly had to work hard, just to survive and raise a family. \n\nLife was no doubt much harder then than any of us can really imagine, but [you try and tell that to the young people of today. Would they believe you? No!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKHFZBUTA4k)\n\nMy great grandmother, Ellen, was committed to Lancaster Asylum some time after my grandmother Freda was born.

Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t a main road, it was the road on our council estate. Pretty much everyone had a car, and many of the houses had their own garage.</p>\n<p>In London, or Greater London, it&rsquo;s generally not safe for kids to play in the street, although we&rsquo;re lucky where we are that our little <em>cul-de-sac</em> can double-up as a relatively safe enough play area most of the time.</p>\n<p>The road next to us is an HGV Access Road, thanks to our local ward councillor and current council leader.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s definitely NOT safe for kids to play in at all.</p>\n<p>Not until the Water Company came along. For the past two or three weeks, they have closed part of the road where my sons' friends live to clear the pipes of wet wipes, sanitary products, fat and oil.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;ve dug a massive hole in the road, which I&rsquo;ve told my nine year old is <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/06/class.html\"><em>The Pit of Tartarus</em></a>. It&rsquo;s all barricaded off, with heavy machinery, waste skips and various bits of equipment.</p>\n<p>So the road is now a no through road, with access only for residents and deliveries.</p>\n<p>My kids and their friends have really enjoyed playing out in the street whenever they can, thanks also to our &ldquo;Indian Summer&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are plenty of drivers who ignore (or don&rsquo;t see?) the signs telling them the road is closed, and drive down it anyway. My job was mostly to tell them, &ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t drive on the pavement. Can&rsquo;t you see there are kids playing? Plus, it&rsquo;s a pavement.

				"content_text": "We used to play in the street outside our home as kids growing up in the 70s. In rural Lincolnshire. Of course, it wasn't a main road, it was the road on our council estate. Pretty much everyone had a car, and many of the houses had their own garage.\n\nIn London, or Greater London, it's generally not safe for kids to play in the street, although we're lucky where we are that our little *cul-de-sac* can double-up as a relatively safe enough play area most of the time.\n\nThe road next to us is an HGV Access Road, thanks to our local ward councillor and current council leader.\n\nIt's definitely NOT safe for kids to play in at all.\n\nNot until the Water Company came along. For the past two or three weeks, they have closed part of the road where my sons' friends live to clear the pipes of wet wipes, sanitary products, fat and oil.\n\nThey've dug a massive hole in the road, which I've told my nine year old is [*The Pit of Tartarus*](https://davidmarsden.info/2023/10/06/class.html). It's all barricaded off, with heavy machinery, waste skips and various bits of equipment.\n\nSo the road is now a no through road, with access only for residents and deliveries.\n\nMy kids and their friends have really enjoyed playing out in the street whenever they can, thanks also to our \"Indian Summer\".\n\nOf course, there are plenty of drivers who ignore (or don't see?) the signs telling them the road is closed, and drive down it anyway. My job was mostly to tell them, \"No, you can't drive on the pavement. Can't you see there are kids playing? Plus, it's a pavement. This isn't the Wild West!\" \n\nFortunately, everyone was reasonable enough when challenged to back away, turnaround and drive around following the \"diverted traffic\" signs.\n\nThankfully, my job was made redundant by the older kids in the group, who took it upon themselves to relieve me of my onerous duties. They barricaded the pavements with spare cones, and now they marshall the traffic. Much more effective!\n",

Berkeley responded to this request\nand offered a £500 contribution to the event. However, while the offer was publicly acknowledged, the\nmoney was never accepted or received because the Council is committed to not accept sponsorship\nfrom Berkeley for corporate events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The FOI response on the council&rsquo;s relationship with developers was, to my mind, wholly unsatisfactory and generated <a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/ealing_councils_relationships_wi#outgoing-1498781\">a third FOI</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In other words, plain English perhaps, it took two years to put in place any formal procedure to uphold the Leader&rsquo;s stated aims, and there is literally nothing to see to evidence that councillors are following the procedure, or will do. And the fact that there is nothing to see to evidence your claims is, you claim, an indication of the council&rsquo;s commitment to transparency?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s my reply to his reply (via his Head of Cabinet Office).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for passing on Cllr Mason&rsquo;s response. Please pass this on to him.</p>\n<p>I appreciate Cllr Mason&rsquo;s honesty in acknowledging that the Mayor accepted Berkeley Group&rsquo;s offer of sponsorship, contrary to council policy.</p>\n<p>I also appreciate that the Mayor, councillors and officers have been reminded of the policy going forward.</p>\n<p>However, the Mayor&rsquo;s original tweet still stands, published, thanking Berkeley Group for sponsoring the event.</p>\n<p>I would like to know why this tweet has not been retracted or clarified, because it continues to give what I am now asked to believe by Cllr Mason is a wholly misleading statement of Ealing Council policy, as well as free good marketing publicity for what is a proscribed organisation. That&rsquo;s even worse than accepting sponsorship. (I hope that Berkeley Group were asked to donate their sponsorship directly to one of the Mayor&rsquo;s charities instead.)</p>\n<p>I would like Cllr Mason, the council leader, to ensure that the Mayor removes and publicly clarifies and apologises for his tweet, and mistakenly accepting Berkeley&rsquo;s offer. I would like him to explain why it was a mistake and why it&rsquo;s necessary to apologise.</p>\n<p>In Southall, we&rsquo;ve suffered, as Cllr Mason recently acknowledged in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/M_vj2l2_JuY\">one of his self-promotion videos</a>, six years of &ldquo;many, many terrible smells and certainly some bad chemicals released into the environment&rdquo;, which have undoubtedly caused long-term mental and physical health problems for residents young and old.</p>\n<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t need to remind anyone that Southall is home to by far the largest South Asian and Black community in Ealing, and the lowest average incomes, who are among the most vulnerable to the adverse health impacts of these &ldquo;bad chemicals&rdquo;. In addition, Southall residents live with some of the worst air pollution in Ealing from traffic congestion, FM Conway asphalt plant, and non-permitted incinerators. Some environmental justice campaigners describe this as a &ldquo;sacrifice zone&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>So, it&rsquo;s very hurtful, insulting and offensive to people in Southall, who have suffered and sacrificed so much, to see the new Mayor break the council leader&rsquo;s pledge, and offer no public retraction, acknowledgement, clarification or apology. It&rsquo;s as if his words have no consequences. It&rsquo;s as if South Asian and Black lives don&rsquo;t matter, or South Asian and Blacks don&rsquo;t count.</p>\n<p>I would also question how the offer of sponsorship came about. We all know that the person responsible for &ldquo;Community Liaison&rdquo; for Berkeley Group is Jags Sanghera, who was a Labour Party councillor candidate in last year&rsquo;s local elections. Why is Jags, who came close to being elected as a councillor, offering sponsorship to the Mayor? It does make me wonder if councillors (and prospective councillors) have ever been told of the council policy, and when? Not to mention the obvious conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>Will Cllr Mason establish a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy for accepting sponsorship, gifts and hospitality going forward (and, perhaps, apply it retrospectively)?</p>\n<p>With regard to Cllr Jassal&rsquo;s participation in Berkeley Group&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Engagement&rdquo; steering group, I&rsquo;d have more confidence in Cllr Mason&rsquo;s assertion that this is to hold them to account if the group wasn&rsquo;t set up and controlled by Berkeley Group and Jags Sanghera. Were CASH invited to be members? Was I? No. Why not? Because as far as I can see, we are among the only people who do consistently try to hold Berkeley Group to account, and their relationship with the council.</p>\n<p>As Cllr Mason addressed his reply to me to Angela and CASH as well, I&rsquo;ve copied them in to this.</p>\n<p>Yours&hellip;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

However, while the offer was publicly acknowledged, the \nmoney was never accepted or received because the Council is committed to not accept sponsorship \nfrom Berkeley for corporate events. \n\nThe FOI response on the council's relationship with developers was, to my mind, wholly unsatisfactory and generated [a third FOI](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/ealing_councils_relationships_wi#outgoing-1498781):\n\n> In other words, plain English perhaps, it took two years to put in place any formal procedure to uphold the Leader's stated aims, and there is literally nothing to see to evidence that councillors are following the procedure, or will do. And the fact that there is nothing to see to evidence your claims is, you claim, an indication of the council's commitment to transparency?\n\nAnyway, here's my reply to his reply (via his Head of Cabinet Office).\n\n------------\n\nThanks for passing on Cllr Mason's response. Please pass this on to him.\n\nI appreciate Cllr Mason's honesty in acknowledging that the Mayor accepted Berkeley Group's offer of sponsorship, contrary to council policy.\n\nI also appreciate that the Mayor, councillors and officers have been reminded of the policy going forward.\n\nHowever, the Mayor's original tweet still stands, published, thanking Berkeley Group for sponsoring the event.\n\nI would like to know why this tweet has not been retracted or clarified, because it continues to give what I am now asked to believe by Cllr Mason is a wholly misleading statement of Ealing Council policy, as well as free good marketing publicity for what is a proscribed organisation. That's even worse than accepting sponsorship. (I hope that Berkeley Group were asked to donate their sponsorship directly to one of the Mayor's charities instead.)\n\nI would like Cllr Mason, the council leader, to ensure that the Mayor removes and publicly clarifies and apologises for his tweet, and mistakenly accepting Berkeley's offer. I would like him to explain why it was a mistake and why it's necessary to apologise. \n\nIn Southall, we've suffered, as Cllr Mason recently acknowledged in [one of his self-promotion videos](https://youtu.be/M_vj2l2_JuY), six years of \"many, many terrible smells and certainly some bad chemicals released into the environment\", which have undoubtedly caused long-term mental and physical health problems for residents young and old. \n\nI hope I don't need to remind anyone that Southall is home to by far the largest South Asian and Black community in Ealing, and the lowest average incomes, who are among the most vulnerable to the adverse health impacts of these \"bad chemicals\". In addition, Southall residents live with some of the worst air pollution in Ealing from traffic congestion, FM Conway asphalt plant, and non-permitted incinerators. Some environmental justice campaigners describe this as a \"sacrifice zone\". \n\nSo, it's very hurtful, insulting and offensive to people in Southall, who have suffered and sacrificed so much, to see the new Mayor break the council leader's pledge, and offer no public retraction, acknowledgement, clarification or apology. It's as if his words have no consequences. It's as if South Asian and Black lives don't matter, or South Asian and Blacks don't count. \n\nI would also question how the offer of sponsorship came about. We all know that the person responsible for \"Community Liaison\" for Berkeley Group is Jags Sanghera, who was a Labour Party councillor candidate in last year's local elections. Why is Jags, who came close to being elected as a councillor, offering sponsorship to the Mayor? It does make me wonder if councillors (and prospective councillors) have ever been told of the council policy, and when? Not to mention the obvious conflict of interest.\n\nWill Cllr Mason establish a \"zero tolerance\" policy for accepting sponsorship, gifts and hospitality going forward (and, perhaps, apply it retrospectively)?\n\nWith regard to Cllr Jassal's participation in Berkeley Group's \"Community Engagement\" steering group, I'd have more confidence in Cllr Mason's assertion that this is to hold them to account if the group wasn't set up and controlled by Berkeley Group and Jags Sanghera. Were CASH invited to be members? Was I? No. Why not? Because as far as I can see, we are among the only people who do consistently try to hold Berkeley Group to account, and their relationship with the council.\n\nAs Cllr Mason addressed his reply to me to Angela and CASH as well, I've copied them in to this.\n\nYours...\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-title=\"\" data-author=\"David Marsden\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/davidmarsden/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2023/07/07/open-letter-to.html\">Open letter to Peter Mason  <img src=\"https://micro.blog/photos/50/https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/20230701-1318193.jpg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" class=\"mini_thumbnail\">  <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2023/07/07/open-letter-to.html\">davidmarsden.info</a><footer>David Marsden <cite><a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2023/07/07/open-letter-to.html\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">https://davidmarsden.info/2023/07/07/open-letter-to.html</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n",

That may be true, but I didn't *feel* safer, and there were no [buses to flag down](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/01/police-must-win-back-public-confidence-after-sarah-everard-case-says-minister).\n\nThe children learned that murderous megalomaniac misogynist King Henry VIII is still held in very high regard in these parts, despite beheading two of his six wives, and creating a new religion and laws to divorce two more.\n\nI asked the children how the chamber of the House of Lords made them feel.\n\n> Small.\n\nWe had lunch across the road outside Portcullis House where we could shelter a little from the wind and rain. Portcullis House is where elected Members of Parliament (MP) and their staff have offices. There were lots of posh-looking mostly white men going in and out and getting frisked inside by more armed guards. Out in the cold, we shared our lunch with toothless and homeless Len, who we found sleeping in the doorway next to us, and looking very wet and cold. Len told us he was \"a midget, a dwarf from Burnley\" and he'd come to London to sort his life out, but his marriage failed and here he was. He was very pleased to have a homemade tuna mayonnaise sandwich, a juice drink and a satsuma. My wife told me off when we got home, claiming that he will have sold or exchanged the sandwich for drugs.\n\nWe waited for our own MP [Virendra Sharma](https://davidmarsden.info/2022/02/11/trigger-vote-for.html) to come and meet us as the teachers had arranged. No one knew what he looked like, so they asked me as my lad told them I had met him before (which is true). Then we played a game \"Where's Sharma?\" until he appeared. Mr Sharma thanked the kids for coming to meet him, and asked them who wanted his job. His two assistants took photographs.\n\nWe ended the day by getting drenched walking up to see Downing Street and the Horse Guards Parade. Downing Street was, of course, guarded by more armed police and totally inaccessible to us ordinary folk, and the parade smelled of horse shit.\n",

I&rsquo;ll say more on these later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve air quality</li>\n<li>Tackling the climate crisis</li>\n<li>Fighting inequality</li>\n<li>Protect biodiversity</li>\n<li>Protect health and wellbeing</li>\n<li>Raise public awareness</li>\n<li>Promote sustainable infrastructure</li>\n<li>Support the transition to clean energy</li>\n<li>Creating good jobs</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"inequalities\">Inequalities</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/30e2e26fd7.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\"></p>\n<p><em>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk in Ealing&rsquo;s air quality strategy about being inclusive and &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; (&ldquo;reducing&rdquo; would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; (&ldquo;exhaust trail&rdquo; might be more apt?). I&rsquo;m not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"public-health-policy\">Public Health Policy</h3>\n<p>The strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks.</p>\n<p><em>When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action</a>), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we&rsquo;ll see later, promoting active travel.</em></p>\n<p>In contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio</a>).</p>\n<p>*There&rsquo;s obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Good Growth</a>), and social policy (<a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Tackling Inequalities</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.</strong></p>\n<p>The strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant.</p>\n<p><em>Ealing&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profiles/2019/E09000009.html?area-name=Ealing\">Health Profile from 2019</a> puts that figure in some context:</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/79dfdefa37.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Ealing&rsquo;s 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\" title=\"Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"air-pollution-in-ealing\">Air Pollution in Ealing</h2>\n<h3 id=\"pollution-sources\">Pollution Sources</h3>\n<p>The strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy.</p>\n<p>Those most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women.</p>\n<p><strong>It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo;, especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).</strong></p>\n<p><em>I don&rsquo;t believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.</em></p>\n<p>The strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.</p>\n<p><em>Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/b3477cab4c.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\"></p>\n<p><em>On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/6301e51513.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\"></p>\n<p><em>In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn&rsquo;t get a look-in at all, data from 2013.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/a517ab2e6a.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\"></p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council&rsquo;s key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.</em></p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"air-quality-monitoring\">Air Quality Monitoring</h3>\n<p>The strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/601d0ed36b.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\"></p>\n<p><em>It&rsquo;s worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/pm2.5_in_london_october19.pdf\" title=\"PDF\">background levels of PM2.5</a> in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO&rsquo;s target.</em></p>\n<p>The draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.</p>\n<p>Ealing has 67 air quality monitors acrosss the borough, all recording levels of notrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulater matter (PM10 only).</p>\n<p><em>It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although their are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as <a href=\"https://www.airqualityengland.co.uk/local-authority/?la_id=191\" title=\"Air Quality England: Southall monitors\">The Green Quarter</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Ealing publishes annual air quality <a href=\"https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/Reports.aspx\">status reports</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Ealing also has <a href=\"https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/DiffusionTubes.aspx\">an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites</a> where you can see graphical annual data summary charts.

Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council&rsquo;s response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn&rsquo;t give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Wouldn&rsquo;t this be fantastic?! Again, the Council&rsquo;s response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Invest in green infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Southall has the least <a href=\"https://www.ealingitree.online/stories/canopy-cover/0\" title=\"Tree canopy cover in Ealing\">tree canopy cover in Ealing</a>, yet is subjected to <a href=\"https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns\" title=\"Over-development of Southall\">massive overdevelopment</a>. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.</em></p>\n<p><em>The one concession negotiated hard for by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the &lsquo;reset&rsquo; button. Having sat on the Mayor&rsquo;s money and done nothing for so long it&rsquo;s no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new &lsquo;pocket park&rsquo; outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-&lsquo;orchards&rsquo; planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the &lsquo;Poison Park&rsquo; to look forward to, the &lsquo;green space&rsquo; crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.</em></p>\n<p><strong>If the council&rsquo;s air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a &lsquo;compromise&rsquo; to <a href=\"https://ealing.news/environment/environmentalists-tell-ealing-council-and-its-leader-peter-mason-their-actions-will-result-in-ecocide-and-are-environmentally-reckless-and-ecologically-illiterate-over-warren-farm-sports-p\" title=\"Ealing News coverage of Warren Farm story\">destroy most of the already re-wilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall</a> in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don&rsquo;t want.

It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”.

We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!</p>\n<h3 id=\"public-health\">Public Health</h3>\n<p>We are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. <strong>Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?</strong> The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?</p>\n<p>Moreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years' of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. <strong>Why wasn&rsquo;t truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"enforcement\">Enforcement</h3>\n<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?</p>\n<p>The council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks.

The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. <strong>Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/ffb64911e1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don&rsquo;t reduce air pollution\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution\"></p>\n<p>b. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. <strong>Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.</strong></p>\n<p>c.

				"content_text": "Ealing Council's [draft Air Quality Strategy][1] is a 64 page document together with a 40 page [Action Plan][2], and the consultation period runs until 30 January 2023. It's taken me the best part of six weeks, all my spare time over Christmas and New Year, to get through it all, make notes and cross-reference to try to make sense of it all and offer some feedback. \n\nReally, there must be a much longer consultation period if Ealing Council is genuinely interested in residents' views.\n\nThe following is a summary of what the key points of interest are for me, and in particular in relation to Southall, where I live and work. My additional suggestions are **in bold**, and my comments and questions in *italics*.\n\n#### Warning\n\nThis is a LONG post. I've tried to break it into sections to make it easier to read.\n\n#### Disclaimer \n\n*I don't claim to be an expert, other than through experience. I am just an ordinary resident living in the midst of four major industrial and construction site polluters for several years. I have campaigned alongside my family, neighbours and friends for clean air after my then nearly four year old said he wanted fresh air not stinky air. He'd been hospitalised three times when he was two and diagnosed with asthma. We soon discovered people who had lost loved ones, had heart attacks, ectopic pregnancies, cancer, all attributed to the foul petrochemical stink.*\n\n*I welcome any corrections.*\n\n# My Summary\n\n**If Ealing is serious about \"fighting\" inequalities, action must be targeted to protect vulnerable people in Southall to reduce air pollution and its impact on the health of its large, mostly economically deprived and non-white population.**\n\n**The Strategy and Plan must target children and older people, people with lung conditions, and pregnant women: outside schools and school run hours. The Council must question if it is ethical to promote active travel in Southall when it knows that it is a high pollution area and that most of its population is particularly vulnerable to its adverse health impacts.**\n\nThe draft strategy and action plan don't do this at all.\n\n---\n\n# Clean Air for Ealing!\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/35d32fbea6.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents\")\n\n*To begin, I think it’s fantastic that Ealing Council has stated its vision for clean air for all Ealing residents, in alignment with that of local residents’ campaign group [Clean Air for Southall and Hayes][3] (CASH).*\n\n*CASH has been [asking for clean air for residents in Southall and Hayes since 2018][4].*\n\n![Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a comminity group fighting for our righ to breathe clean air](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/4bb932f46f.png \"Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a comminity group fighting for our righ to breathe clean air\")\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the Strategy and Action Plan\n\nEaling's draft air quality strategy's five stated priorities are to:\n\n> - Reduce road traffic emissions\n> - Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning\n> - Reduce emissions from construction of new developments\n> - Invest in green infrastructure\n> - Raise awareness of air quality\n\n**It would be useful to see the strategy and action plan follow the same structure with clear definitions of terms, and specific and detailed aims and objectives for each priority, along with baseline air pollution levels and equalities data for each in order to monitor and measure impact.**\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/8fc38abd8c.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport\")\n\nSomewhat confusingly, the action plan groups its actions into six categories: \n\n> - Emissions from Developments and Buildings\n> - Public health and awareness raising\n> - Delivery servicing and freight\n> - Borough fleet actions\n> - Localised solutions\n> - Cleaner transport\n\n*This maybe because they are copied and pasted from the previous [2017-22 action plan][5].*\n\n**It would be better for understanding, monitoring and evaluation to have consistency and coherence between the two documents, updating the action plan where necessary to reflect this.**\n\nAlso somewhat confusingly, Ealing's draft air quality strategy has nine stated goals, starting with the obvious. I'll say more on these later:\n\n> 1. Improve air quality\n> 2. Tackling the climate crisis\n> 3. Fighting inequality\n> 4. Protect biodiversity\n> 5. Protect health and wellbeing\n> 6. Raise public awareness\n> 7. Promote sustainable infrastructure\n> 8. Support the transition to clean energy\n> 9. Creating good jobs\n\n---\n\n### Inequalities \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/30e2e26fd7.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\")\n\n*There's a lot of talk in Ealing's air quality strategy about being inclusive and \"fighting\" (\"reducing\" would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution \"footprint\" (\"exhaust trail\" might be more apt?). I'm not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.*\n\n---\n\n### Public Health Policy\n\nThe strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks. \n\n*When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the [Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action][6]), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we'll see later, promoting active travel.*\n\nIn contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing's [Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio][6]).\n\n*There's obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or [Good Growth][6]), and social policy ([Tackling Inequalities][6]). \n\n**It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.**\n\nThe strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant. \n\n*Ealing's [Health Profile from 2019][7] puts that figure in some context:*\n\n![Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/79dfdefa37.png \"Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\")\n\n---\n\n## Air Pollution in Ealing\n\n### Pollution Sources \n\nThe strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy. \n\nThose most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women. \n\n**It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution \"hotspots\", especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).** \n\n*I don't believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.*\n\nThe strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.\n\n*Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).*\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/b3477cab4c.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\")\n\n*On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):*\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/6301e51513.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\")\n\n*In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn't get a look-in at all, data from 2013.* \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/a517ab2e6a.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\")\n\n**It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.**\n\n*The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council's key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.* \n\n**It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.**\n\n---\n\n### Air Quality Monitoring \n\nThe strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/601d0ed36b.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air qulaity guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\")\n\n*It's worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the [background levels of PM2.5][8] in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO's target.*\n\nThe draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.\n\nEaling has 67 air quality monitors acrosss the borough, all recording levels of notrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulater matter (PM10 only). \n\n*It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although their are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as [The Green Quarter][9].*\n\nEaling publishes annual air quality [status reports][10].\n\n*Ealing also has [an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites][11] where you can see graphical annual data summary charts. Unfortunately, none seem to have been updated since 2021.*\n\n![Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/7736b00dee.png \"Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021\") \n\n**It would be useful to have more monitors for particulate matter, especially PM2.5, across the borough, and in Southall, and for published data from all air pollution monitors to be kept accessible and up-to-date.**\n\n---\n\n## Priorities for Action\n\nBack to the strategy's priorities for action, and my *comments and questions*, and **suggestions**.\n\n> - Reduce road traffic emissions. \n\n*The biggest reduction in road traffic emissions came during 2020 covid lockdowns, and while it's not practical, feasible or desirable to replicate that going forward, it might be worth promoting the idea that employers should encourage and support an increase to the 36% of Ealing's working age population already mainly [working from home][12] whenever possible, as opposed to the current political groupthink that everyone must return to the office in order to be productive.*\n\n> - Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning. \n\n*There are two wood-burning incinerators close to my home, which frequently create disgusting burning plastic odours forcing us to stay indoors and close all our windows. Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council's response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn't give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.*\n\n> - Reduce emissions from construction of new developments. \n\n*Wouldn't this be fantastic?! Again, the Council's response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?*\n\n> - Invest in green infrastructure. \n\n*Southall has the least [tree canopy cover in Ealing][13], yet is subjected to [massive overdevelopment][14]. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.* \n\n*The one concession negotiated hard for by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the 'reset' button. Having sat on the Mayor's money and done nothing for so long it's no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new 'pocket park' outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-'orchards' planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the 'Poison Park' to look forward to, the 'green space' crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.*\n\n**If the council's air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.** \n\n*Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a 'compromise' to [destroy most of the already re-wilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall][15] in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don't want. I don't understand how the Leader's desires complement the Council's stated strategies to reduce air pollution, tackle the climate emergency they declared, and to protect and promote biodiversity and our ecosystem.*\n\n- Raise awareness of air quality. \n\n*The council also wants to (and must) lead by example.* \n\n**If the council really wants to lead by example on reducing air pollution, then the council Leader cannot accept or request car rides to or from meetings in Southall, councillors cannot park in cycle lanes in Southall, nor fly to the property developer festival in the south of France. They must engage with Southall residents suffering the worst of the air pollution from multiple sources, and stop denying or minimising the existence and extent of the problems, and proactively and collaboratively work to reduce or stop such pollution episodes continuing.** \n\n*Otherwise, the council's strategy isn't worth the virtual paper it's printed on, and is just more hot air.*\n\n*What we have in the draft plan, however, is largely a copy-and-paste of the previous 2017-2022 plan, which was, at worst, a demonstrable failure of ambition, leadership and political will, and, at best, a simple failure of the council to do what it said it would do.*\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Goals\n\n> 1. Improve air quality. Protect the health and wellbeing of Ealing residents from the harmful effects\n> of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) air pollution. \n\n**The strategy MUST have the inclusive goal of protecting residents from the harmful effects of ALL air pollutants (not just nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter).**.\n\n> 2. Tackling the climate crisis.... by aiming for the highest environmental standards. \n\n**The \"highest environmental standards\" must be clearly stated and defined.**\n\n> 3. Fighting inequality.... to ensure that no-one is left behind... [and] residents feel safe. \n\n**The strategy must ensure that inequalities are reduced, that ALL residents are included in this process, and that their concerns for the safety of their air are taken seriously and acted upon.** *Promoting the uptake of expensive electric vehicles and discounting parking spaces for them is discriminating against economically deprived mostly non-white people who suffer most from air pollution.*\n\n> 4. Protect biodiversity. Ensuring our parks, open spaces and nature are protected and enhanced. \n\n*This is particularly relevant right now, as the Council Leader pushes on with his undemocratic desire to destroy much of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall, and killing off a quarter of London's endangered skylarks, in order to build new sports pitches and/or a football stadium.*\n\n> 5. Protect health and wellbeing. Protecting and enhancing the physical and mental health of all. \n\n*Except in Southall? [Public Health England's four risk assessment reports][16] into the Southall Gasworks poisoning clearly stated that \"Odours can cause nuisance amongst the population possibly leading to stress and anxiety. Some people may experience symptoms such as nausea, headaches or dizziness.\"*\n\n> 6. Raise public awareness. Promoting awareness of the causes and impacts of air quality issues, as well as the available local solutions.... encouraging community activism.... \n\n*Except in Southall? At every opportunity, Ealing Council has sought to erase, deny or minimise the the causes and impacts of air quality issues related to Southall Gasworks, refused to enforce any local solutions, and actively discouraged and attempted to prevent community activists' voices from being heard.*\n\n> 7. Promote sustainable infrastructure. Ensure local transport and development planning supports investment in sustainable infrastructure, that limits impact on air quality, enabling a shift to low-emission transport and energy options. \n\n*Except in Southall? The Council recently [decided NOT to widen the South Road bridge in Southall][17]. Widening the bridge, as promised, would ease congestion, and improve air quality, public transport and active travel options. The bridge widening was the one concession granted to the Southall community when the London Mayor overruled local democracy to give the go ahead to developement of the highly contaminated Southall Gasworks site.*\n\n> 8. Support the transition to clean energy. Supporting the uptake of low-emission energy technologies and improvements in efficiencies, and reducing reliance on the consumption of fossil and solid fuels. \n\n*Like [in Chile][18]? Simply promoting and encouraging more (low emission) cars isn’t going to reduce congestion, emissions from brake and tyre wear, or help to reduce our “reliance on the consumption of fossil fuels”. Ealing [reportedly doesn’t have enough power on the electricity grid for new homes until 2030][19].* \n\n> 9. Creating good jobs. We want to... deliver an ambitious programme of building more genuinely affordable homes. \n\n*Ealing is [building fewer genuinely affordable homes than ever][20], and [making the housing crisis in Ealing worse][21] by [demolishing more social rent homes][22] than it is building.*\n\n---\n\n## Spotlight on Southall \n\nThese are all my comments, so I'm not putting it all in *italics.*\n\nMy suggestions and questions for the strategy are still in **bold.**\n\n**Southall cannot be used as a good example of how Ealing Council takes air pollution seriously.** \n\n### Inequalities\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/6a220c535f.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people\") \n\nSouthall has a [BAME population of more than 90%][23].\n\nSouthall Broadway/West and Southall Green are the two council wards that border the old Gasworks site, and which are downwind from the FM Conway asphalt and Tarmac plants, and the two wood-burning incinerators, depending on wind direction. They are connected by the Gasworks site and by the Air Quality Focus Area from South Road to The Green, King Street and Western Road.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/bbcfb05232.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites\")\n\nSouthall is already a high pollution area (and an Air Quality Focus Area as a result), but has several additive sources of unmitigated, uncontrolled air pollution.\n\nEconomically poorer, BAME people, children, older people and pregnant women are the most vulnerable to the health impacts of toxic air pollution. Certainly not a fairer start for Southall’s children.\n\nWe know from bitter experience over the last six years in Southall that the council has failed in its duty to protect some of its most vulnerable residents from harm.\n\n### Raising Awareness\n\nTo add insult to injury, the council failed to raise public awareness of the risks and the air quality monitoring data in an open and transparent manner before work on the site began, and while the work was in progress. It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”. Residents were never informed if, when or how levels of naphthalene were urgently reduced.\n\n![Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/16631f69b8.png \"Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\")\n\nIt’s noteworthy that the Council claims it asked PHE to get involved only [“following concerns raised by local residents”][24] and not because the Council itself carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment prior to works starting in 2016, knowing that the Southall population was significantly more vulnerable to air pollution due to high pre-existing levels and multiple inequalities.\n\nSimilarly, the council says it responded to residents' concerns by installing \"independent\" air quality monitors on site in 2021, but this is five years after the work started, and two years after the main source of air pollution and odour complaints (the so-called soil \"hospital\") was decommissioned. The monitors now installed record near-real time data for “urban background” emissions of odourless particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/e8d8fc3af0.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns\")\n\nThe odours and air pollution that residents are concerned about originate from polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (i.e., the hundred years’ of toxic waste from town gas, coal tar and petrochemical work sites). We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!\n\n### Public Health\n\nWe are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. **Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?** The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?\n\nMoreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years' of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and \"cleaned\" in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. **Why wasn't truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?**\n\n### Enforcement\n\nWhy didn't the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?\n\nThe council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks. Indeed half of the plan was missing from the planning portal and [the council admitted that it didn't have a full copy of the original CMP][25]. \n\n**How on earth was the council planning to enforce a CMP it wasn’t in possession of?** This was a gross dereliction of duty to care for the health and wellbeing of (by its own definition) the most vulnerable residents in the borough.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/d485373622.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites\")\n\n**The Council was committed to full enclosure of waste sites in its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan. Why wasn’t the one hundred years of petrochemical waste \"soil cleaning hospital” enclosed?**\n\n[National Grid have enclosed their enclosed their soil remediation work][26] specifically to avoid causing odour nuisance to the local community (and thanks no doubt to campaigning by local residents and activists at Clean Air for Southall and Hayes).\n\n### On Whose Side?\n\nWhy did the former and current council leader [accept over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group][27] to fly (!) to the south of France for what Private Eye Magazine describes as [a booze and hookerfest][28]?\n\nThe new council leader claims he went there to negotiate hard. If that's the case, what did he negotiate? He also claimed that it wasn't what he expected and that it was a mistake to go. If that's also the case, [why was it a mistake][29]?\n\n**How can we be sure that the new council leader and his administration won't continue making these mistakes and taking the side of developers rather than standing up for the residents they are elected to represent?**\n\n### Local  Action\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/c66801e7f1.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response\")\n\n**If the soil is now clean and the air is safe to breathe, why would stopping works during hot weather (which didn’t happen in 2018), and covering stockpiles (why weren’t they covered already?) be given as examples of possible mitigating actions?**\n\n**There must be a new commitment to work with and for residents where these are issues. Air pollution and odour nuisance reporting and investigation procedures need to be overhauled as they are currently not fit for purpose (reporting process too convoluted, each one investigated as a single, isolated incident rather than as part of an ongoing problem, residents are simply not believed and our reports are minimised and invalidated).** \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/d0a9b295be.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality\")\n\n**Work on the Gasworks site is due to complete in 2038. Why is the date for net-zero emissions set for twelve years after this date in 2050?**\n\nThere's a similar commitment to target zero-emissions for construction vehicles by 2040, which is two years after the new draft local Plan period for new developments ends. \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/c4e6ee2c8e.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers\")\n\n**What has Ealing Council done to date to campaign for greater regulatory powers and for a Clean Air Act? Please give examples.**\n\nThis draft Air Quality Strategy is fine in many respects in terms of the words it contains, but what concerns me is that these are empty words if they are not acted on and enforced.\n\nRecent history strongly suggests the council doesn't have the leadership, organisational culture or political will to act in the interests of its most vulnerable residents in Southall.\n\n### Active Travel\n\nThere's a lot of talk about active travel and Ealing Council's multi-million pound Let's Go Southall campaign in the draft Strategy, but [very little on its real cost and impact][31]. They seem to have about 50 regular weekly activity groups. Over two years that's 5,000 sessions. 30,000 attendances (not individuals). So average of six people per session? 1,000 people attended at least two sessions (repeat attendances). My guess would be not many more than 1,000 in total, most will be repeaters (thinking GP referrals, lots of organisers?). If it's helped 1,000 individuals, that's £5,400 per person. If 10,000 it's £540 per person (still seems like a lot of money). And there's no evidence that it's helped anyone! \n\n**The council must be open and transparent with residents that Let's Go Southall is a top-down neoliberal behavioural change (\"nudge theory\") programme led by a retired stockbroker, and not the \"grassroots social movement\" of the council's Orwellian publicity.**\n\n**If the Council is serious about improving safe active travel options in Southall, then it must improve road and pavement conditions and safety first. Many of the roads and pavements are not fit to cycle or walk on, especially for children and families, older people, and people with disabilities.**\n\n---\n\n# Air Quality Action Plan\n\n## The 2017-2022 Action Plan\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/da4994ee82.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution\")\n\na. Included a number of no-or-low-impact schemes such as Low Emission Neighbourhoods (LENs), implemented in 2021 as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. **Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?**\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/ffb64911e1.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution\")\n\nb. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. **Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.**\n\nc. Another low impact scheme was Play Streets. **How many Play Streets are there now? How often do they run? Where are they?**\n\nd. **How many Pocket Parks are there? Where are they?**\n\ne. **How many Green Screens  are there? Where are they? Why were green screens not erected at Southall Gasworks even after residents complained of dust from the site in their homes?**\n\nf. **How are these schemes evaluated in terms of reducing air pollution? Where are the air quality monitors located to record baseline measurements to compare against air pollution levels during or after the scheme is in place?**\n\ng. **Enforcement of anti-idling laws was deemed \"not cost-effective\". Smoke control was not deemed a problem and therefore not promoted or enforced. Who made these decisions?**\n\nh. **What is the wider 'cost' to residents in not taking enforcement action against these criminal behaviours?**\n\n## The 2022-2027 Action Plan (AQAP)\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/a6a7ae4c4e.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone\")\n\n**If air pollution monitoring data cannot inform the efficacy of individual actions, how can it be used in combination with secondary data to do so?** I'm sure there must be a sensible explanation, but to most people I suspect this statement makes little sense. In Southall, we have continuously been asked to ignore our own lived experience of health and quality of life problems attributed to the open-air 'cleaning' of a hundred years of petrochemical waste at the Gasworks site, in favour of the developer Berkeley's assurances that it's own monitoring of air quality is 'within acceptable limits' and harmless to health. Public Health England published four risk assessments based on Berkeley's data, and came to similar conclusions, although neither looked at any secondary data. The air pollution data has still to be published so that the public can make up their own minds.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/8b107c503e.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution\")\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/4cd9b2f1fa.png)\n\nI'm not sure how imperceptible changes that cannot be detected by monitoring or modelling can be interpreted as Low Impact or a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Action Plan here seems to contradict the Strategy by stating that changes in the levels of air pollution above a certain level can be attributed even to individual actions (although more likely to be due to multiple actions).\n\n**If the council is serious about using air pollution data and secondary data to establish efficacy of its air quality strategy and action plan, (which sounds sensible enough), then it must explain what measures it will use, and publish baseline data and regular updates.** \n\nLike it does with its [performance dashboard][30].  \n  \nLooking at the Council's own evaluation of it's 2017-22 Action Plan, I would suggest that it's achievements are minimal, and misleading.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2588/2023/2af9af507b.png \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan\")\n\nElectric Vehicle charging points (p. 30 of 2022 AQAP) were not actually a specified target in the 2017 AQAP, so I'm unsure how this can be claimed as an achievement? Similarly with School Streets and specific cycle lanes. LENS/LTNs were specified as a target, but there is no mention of that fiasco here. **Air quality monitoring data must be used to locate pollution hotspots for any future implementation of LENs/LTNs**\n\nThe 20 mph speed limit was implemented borough-wide, but only since December 2021. Why did it take so long? What is the use of it if it isn’t enforced, especially in Southall?  \n  \n[1]: https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7039/ealing_council_air_quality_strategy_2020-30\n\n[2]:

Labour Council. Our lives didn't matter to them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we are being asked to believe that our MP (who has begun making the right noises two years too late – what happened to the nearly 1,000 signature petition I gave you in 2018 Mr Sharma?) cares and is on our side, and that our local ward councillor cares and always has done. Only Bell is – unusually for him – honest enough not to suddenly pretend he gives a shit about anyone but himself and looking after his own family.</p>\n\n<p>At the packed public meeting in 2019, which our local ward councillor chaired, he and Bell refused to declare their financial interests with Berkeley Group, refused to let me speak with the microphone so that people couldn't hear that the Council, Berkeley Group, the Environment Agency and Public Health England had all colluded to cover up the real level of toxic and carcinogenic air pollution – that it was consistently above legal limits and rising – by manipulating, removing, and presenting the air quality data in such a way as to make it look like it was mostly within legal limits.</p>\n\n<p>At the same meeting, our MP arrived late, mostly unseen, sat silently at the back of the room, and left early, mostly unseen.\nAt the same meeting, a strangely truthful Bell admitted that he had 'known about the nuisance, the BAD nuisance, for two and a half years'! Yet nothing could be done.</p>\n\n<p>Now Peter Mason, free from his constraints as Head of Planning after resigning following his failed coup attempt to take the leadership from Bell last year, is telling us that something could and should have been done, yet all of them remained silent and did nothing for years.</p>\n\n<p>Unbelievable!</p>\n",

He sneaked in, sat at the back mostly unseen by anyone there, and then left early.</p>\n\n<p>A bit like his time as an MP!</p>\n\n<p>So, at this meeting.</p>\n\n<p>We discovered that Asian and African people, the majority of people in Southall, are genetically more at risk from poisoning from naphthalene.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma have to say about that?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>For two years or more, Southallians have complained to Mr Sharma about the oppressive stink, and poison air, coming from the old gasworks site. I have suffered numerous chest infections, my wife had serious and severe health problems, and my young son has been hospitalised with asthma and now has to take steroids every day of his life so that he can breathe. I know neighbours whose loved ones have now got cancer, and some who have died from cancer. All, we believe, caused by the poison air.</p>\n\n<p>What has Mr Sharma done to help us?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, a group of us presented Mr Sharma with a petition signed by 900 Southallians and their families and friends begging Mr Sharma to do something to get Berkeley Group, the developer of the old gasworks site, to stop poisoning Southall.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma do?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, throughout the last couple of years, while his constituents in Southall Green have been poisoned by the toxic air from the old gasworks site, and getting ill with breathing problems, and cancer, the developer Berkeley Group has sponsored numerous local events, mainly to 'clean up' Southall.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma do?</p>\n\n<p>He attended every one and was photographed smiling broadly wearing his hi-viz jacket with the Berkeley Group logo emblazoned across it.</p>\n\n<p>So tonight, I'm voting in favour of the trigger ballot for Mr Sharma, so that we have the opportunity to have a new Labour MP for Ealing Southall, one who will stand up for local people rather than help those who oppress them.</p>\n\n<p>And I ask all of you to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Solidarity!</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Sharma was triggered for reselection, but survived without having to stand again thanks to his old pal Boris Johnson, who called a general election shortly after.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Last night I arranged to meet a beautiful young woman and we spent an hour together alone in a dingy bedsit.</p>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, I reported a crime. A broken window in an empty first floor flat, a couple of empty cans of Stella Artois in a small black plastic carrier bag, and a toilet bowlful of urine – the water tank had been drained and capped weeks ago, so there was no running water with which to flush away the evidence, or remove the stench. I know this because I work for the landlord.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, after several answerphone messages, crossed wires and missed opportunities in the previous fortnight, Sam from forensics called me and asked me to meet her at the scene in ten minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Half an hour later, in the freezing cold, she arrived, alone, in a small van and armed only with a large suitcase. I wondered about offering to carry it for her, as she was quite small, but thought better of it.</p>\n\n<p>I took Sam up the flight of steps to the disused bedsit, and apologised for the diligence and speed with which our Caretaking and Repairs teams had disturbed the scene of the crime and replaced the broken window without telling me. I had deliberately not reported the broken window to avoid such a scenario.</p>\n\n<p>Sam opened her case and spread out on the floor her clipboard, forms, torch, evidence bags, swabs and other items of detection. She began writing and soon filled up half a page of notes. I apologised for generating so much paperwork for her and joked that she appeared to have even more to do than me. Finally, Sam got down to the nitty gritty. She put on her gloves and took the two empty cans of Stella Artois from the small, black plastic carrier bag and placed them strategically on the floor, several inches apart. She took out a carefully wrapped cotton bud swab, squeezed out some special liquid from a small bottle on to the bud and began rubbing the bud all around the top of the can, paying special attention to the opening and inside the hole. She then placed the swab inside a fresh evidence bag, sealed and signed it. More note taking. I wanted to ask what she was doing, just to break the intense silence, but thought better of it.</p>\n\n<p>Sam wrote another page of notes before examining the now repaired window. She asked me to hold the net curtains up as she couldn't reach, while she dusted the pane for prints. 'Just rub a little bit of washing up liquid on to it to get it off,' she said.</p>\n\n<p>'Thanks. I think I'll leave the washing up until later, though. So what are the chances of finding whodunnit?'</p>\n\n<p>'We'll probably find out who it was. But whether they'll be charged with anything is another matter. They've not done any damage. Probably just looking for somewhere to sleep.'</p>\n\n<p>'Yes. I was kind of hoping you wouldn't find anyone. I feel quite sorry for them. Only two cans of Stella. Although it's premium beer. Quality over quantity, I suppose. It's a shame there are so many empty properties here.'</p>\n\n<p>'Yes, that's the real crime. It makes me really angry. I just wish we had some politicians who listened and did something. But I don't have much hope that anything will ever change.'</p>\n\n<p>Sam gathered up her things and put them back into her suitcase, which she'd been using as a small bench to sit on.' Right, I'm done,' she said, and switched off her torch.</p>\n\n<p>In the gloom, I noticed a square of material on the dirty floor. 'Is this yours?' I turned it over. It was some kind of advertising leaflet. 'Candlelit Dinner For Two,' I heard myself say out loud.</p>\n\n<p>As we left, I thought about asking Sam why she didn't take a sample of the urine, but thought better of it.</p>\n",

(Of course, I realise that they can hardly expect to win the ratings war and/or advertising revenue by informing potential viewers that it’s not likely to be New Improved England, but more Same Old England, if we’re lucky. Especially not when we need all the distraction we can get from the grim reality of how useless and fucked up our country is right now.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Failures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Had Gareth Barry not picked up an injury and had to withdraw from the current squad, England would almost certainly be starting Euro 2012 against France with the same successful central midfield system that ‘Jocky’ McClaren stumbled upon - Gerrard and Barry - just prior to his tactically innovative use of an umbrella as cover in the pissing rain and then being sacked and publicly humiliated for his efforts (which, statistically, were on a par with Sir Bobby Robson’s, and mirrored Sir Alf Ramsey’s and Robson’s failures to qualify for their first tournaments in charge). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two years ago I successfully predicted (admittedly, not hard to do) that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->England didn’t have a hope in hell of winning the World Cup in South Africa<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The good news this time around is that Joe Hart is in goal and that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‘lumbering hulk of long-ball fodder who couldn’t score a goal even if you put it in front of him and offered him £50,000 a week’<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, also known as Emile Heskey, is not even on the standby list (although Andy Carroll does look like a handy replacement).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Left at home<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bad news is that the only English defender we have who has actually proved himself in tournament football, Rio Ferdinand, has been left at home by Old Mother Hodgson because he is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scorpio<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our defence, therefore, is likely to be the same as that which kept out the mighty Algeria, and the smallest nation at the finals two years ago, Slovenia, but with Phil Jagielka or Joleon Lescott replacing former England captain Ferdinand (who of course, was himself replaced before the tournament began due to injury by the injury-prone Ledley King, who of course, was himself replaced due to injury in the first game by Jamie Carragher, who of course, was himself replaced in the third game due to being crap by, er, Stoke bench-warmer Matthew Upson) alongside racist philanderer, and former England captain (twice over) John Terry.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As good a defence, in effect, as that which went on to concede four goals to a proper team, Germany.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Failures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moving on to the midfield (if we can keep possession of the football for long enough) it looks like England will be starting with the same creative talents as in South Africa, bar the injured Barry and Lampard, who will be replaced by the injured Parker and Gerrard. Milner or Walcott (for footballing reasons, presumably) are likely to come in for Aaron Lennon on the right, with Stewart Downing (for footballing reasons… oh, wait) taking over from Milner/Gerrard on the left. Despite my longing for Downing to score the winning goal in a penalty shoot-out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the final against the Germans<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this midfield quartet cannot in any way be described as an improvement on 2010’s fiasco, or even 2008’s failures.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up front, of course, England will have to play proper teams France and Sweden without Wayne Rooney, our one truly world class player. By the time he’s eligible to play in England’s final group game against the co-hosts Ukraine, England are quite likely to be needing a win to have any hope of even qualifying for the quarter-finals.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thoroughly outplayed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->England’s two warm-up games have followed a similar pattern to those in 2010, although perhaps offering a glimmer of hope where two years ago there really was none. In 2010, England were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‘thoroughly outplayed at Wembley by Mexico, only winning by virtue of having taller players, and then, in Austria, thoroughly outplayed by the equally diminutive Japan, only winning by virtue of two fortuitous own goals’<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In 2012, England were thoroughly outplayed in Norway, only winning by virtue of a sublime piece of skill from Ashley Young, and then, at Wembley, thoroughly outplayed by Belgium, only winning by virtue of a sublime piece of skill from Danny Welbeck.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Humiliation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspect that England’s tournament will pan out in equally inglorious fashion, beginning with defeat at the feet of the French, put to the sword in a dire draw by the Swedes, and ignominious exit in the rain against Ukraine. To cope with the likely onset of boredom, depression and homicidal rage, I recommend following the same principles as in my guide to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The World Cup on drugs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if England’s special brand of austerity football means avoiding the pain of humiliation against Spain in the quarter-finals, then it’s surely all for the greater good.</p>\n",

Especially not when we need all the distraction we can get from the grim reality of how useless and fucked up our country is right now.)<br /><h4 id=\"failures\">Failures</h4>Had Gareth Barry not picked up an injury and had to withdraw from the current squad, England would almost certainly be starting Euro 2012 against France with the same successful central midfield system that ‘Jocky’ McClaren stumbled upon - Gerrard and Barry - just prior to his tactically innovative use of an umbrella as cover in the pissing rain and then being sacked and publicly humiliated for his efforts (which, statistically, were on a par with Sir Bobby Robson’s, and mirrored Sir Alf Ramsey’s and Robson’s failures to qualify for their first tournaments in charge). <br /><br />Two years ago I successfully predicted (admittedly, not hard to do) that <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/02/why-england-dont-have-hope-in-hell-of.html\">England didn’t have a hope in hell of winning the World Cup in South Africa</a>. The good news this time around is that Joe Hart is in goal and that the <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/05/no-future-in-englands-dreaming-inside.html\">‘lumbering hulk of long-ball fodder who couldn’t score a goal even if you put it in front of him and offered him £50,000 a week’</a>, also known as Emile Heskey, is not even on the standby list (although Andy Carroll does look like a handy replacement).<br /><h4>Left at home</h4>The bad news is that the only English defender we have who has actually proved himself in tournament football, Rio Ferdinand, has been left at home by Old Mother Hodgson because he is a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/the-game-plan-from-out-of-this-world-zodiac-signs-help-domenech-spot-his-shooting-stars-800471.html\" title=\"Or for footballing reasons. Or whatever.\">Scorpio</a>. <br /><br />Our defence, therefore, is likely to be the same as that which kept out the mighty Algeria, and the smallest nation at the finals two years ago, Slovenia, but with Phil Jagielka or Joleon Lescott replacing former England captain Ferdinand (who of course, was himself replaced before the tournament began due to injury by the injury-prone Ledley King, who of course, was himself replaced due to injury in the first game by Jamie Carragher, who of course, was himself replaced in the third game due to being crap by, er, Stoke bench-warmer Matthew Upson) alongside racist philanderer, and former England captain (twice over) John Terry.<br /><br />As good a defence, in effect, as that which went on to concede four goals to a proper team, Germany.<br /><h4 id=\"failures-1\">Failures</h4>Moving on to the midfield (if we can keep possession of the football for long enough) it looks like England will be starting with the same creative talents as in South Africa, bar the injured Barry and Lampard, who will be replaced by the injured Parker and Gerrard. Milner or Walcott (for footballing reasons, presumably) are likely to come in for Aaron Lennon on the right, with Stewart Downing (for footballing reasons… oh, wait) taking over from Milner/Gerrard on the left. Despite my longing for Downing to score the winning goal in a penalty shoot-out <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/06/the-world-cup-on-drugs-pure-grade.html\">in the final against the Germans</a>, this midfield quartet cannot in any way be described as an improvement on 2010’s fiasco, or even 2008’s failures.<br /><br />Up front, of course, England will have to play proper teams France and Sweden without Wayne Rooney, our one truly world class player. By the time he’s eligible to play in England’s final group game against the co-hosts Ukraine, England are quite likely to be needing a win to have any hope of even qualifying for the quarter-finals.<br /><h4>Thoroughly outplayed</h4>England’s two warm-up games have followed a similar pattern to those in 2010, although perhaps offering a glimmer of hope where two years ago there really was none. In 2010, England were <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/05/no-future-in-englands-dreaming-inside.html\">‘thoroughly outplayed at Wembley by Mexico, only winning by virtue of having taller players, and then, in Austria, thoroughly outplayed by the equally diminutive Japan, only winning by virtue of two fortuitous own goals’</a>. In 2012, England were thoroughly outplayed in Norway, only winning by virtue of a sublime piece of skill from Ashley Young, and then, at Wembley, thoroughly outplayed by Belgium, only winning by virtue of a sublime piece of skill from Danny Welbeck.<br /><h4>Humiliation</h4>I suspect that England’s tournament will pan out in equally inglorious fashion, beginning with defeat at the feet of the French, put to the sword in a dire draw by the Swedes, and ignominious exit in the rain against Ukraine. To cope with the likely onset of boredom, depression and homicidal rage, I recommend following the same principles as in my guide to <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/06/the-world-cup-on-drugs-pure-grade.html\">The World Cup on drugs</a>.<br /><br />And if England’s special brand of austerity football means avoiding the pain of humiliation against Spain in the quarter-finals, then it’s surely all for the greater good.\n",

OK, so there is the untested Joe Hart.</li></ul><ul><li>We don’t have any defenders who are fit or in form. Johnson, Ferdinand and Cole all injured. Terry playing like he has his pants down around his ankles half the time. Replacements (based on Capello’s selections so far) would be Brown, Lescott, Upson and Baines (since the useless Bridge has withdrawn). Other possibilities for left back from the squad might include Barry or Milner. Slightly more left of field, literally as well as metaphorically, would be Warnock and Phil Neville.</li></ul><ul><li>I’m not convinced by our midfield or our formation and tactics playing two wide players and two central midfielders. Lennon is injured, Walcott is recovering from injury. Beckham is fit only for 15 minute cameos. So, Milner looks like he will start on the right and has shown lots of energy and drive. Gerrard seems to be the notional left-sided midfielder now. Barry is the holding midfielder and he has played well for England in that role over the last two years since Steve McClaren put him there. But he looks a shadow of that player now. Lampard is our ‘creative’ attacking midfielder. The same player who can disappear for an entire 90 minutes despite his massive size.</li></ul><ul><li>Although we have one of the best centre forwards in the world in Wayne Rooney, Capello seems to insist on pairing him with one of the worst centre forwards in the world in Emile Heskey. Sorry, but likeable as Emile is - and he tries, I know he tries - he is not up to it. If we are to play with two up front then I’d stick Gerrard in there. Rooney has proved this season beyond any doubt that he can play alone up front provided he has:</li></ul><ol><ol><li>Service from wingers who can get to the byline and cross the ball on to his head.</li><li>Support of two midfielders who - in addition to their defensive and creative duties - can bomb forward to give Rooney the space he needs.</li></ol></ol>Unless Capello surprises me and changes his tactics, formation and line-up I just can’t see it happening.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It’s often the case that what in one sense is an undeniable strength can at the same time also be a real or potential weakness. English football’s great history and tradition raises everyone’s expectations, yet the English football team must compete on an increasingly commercialised and sophisticated international playing field. We have more fans, more money and more foreigners in our game than any other country, so it’s no surprise that when things don’t go to plan, everyone feels quite upset and let down. And the media does its best to blame anyone and everyone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There’s such a lot at stake, now. It was only sixty years or so ago that the Football Association, which is now grieving over the financial loss of failure to qualify for Euro 2008 and stating that qualification for Euro and World Cup Finals is a minimum requirement of the team manager/coach, actively prevented the national team from taking part. It’s only forty years or so since we won it. As it happens, Sir Alf Ramsey, like Second Choice Steve McClaren also failed to qualify for his first Euro Finals in 1964…. We have a long history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world, so it’s not as if it’s anything new or that we should be surprised about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with English football has been documented in the press as being anything from too many foreign players, too much money, expectation of fans not matched with reality, players and coaches not good enough, not enough passion or care, too much passion and not enough technique, too much pressure and fear, too much drinking and not enough team spirit. The reality is probably that all of these factors are important to a lesser or greater degree. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too many foreign players<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Sven-Goran Erikkson points out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, managers often buy overseas players because they are cheaper on average than their English or British counterparts. That’s also why so few of our players play abroad - because there isn’t the money to pay them, not necessarily that they aren’t good enough. Beckham was and arguably still is good enough to play for Real Madrid. That’s why there are too many foreign players.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much money<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So part of the problem may be that the players get paid too much? But that is not the players’ fault, just market forces, mainly to do with Sky TV money and, er, the FA, who contract with them for Premier League (the same FA which hijacked the Football League) and England rights. What this means is that the very best English players - who are on a par at least, with the very best players in the world - are paid significantly more. This is why Arsene Wenger has so few English players in his squad, not because they aren’t good enough, but because they are too expensive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The new Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe I’m wrong, but it seems to me that we are repeating what happened in Scotland during the Graeme Souness era at Rangers - he bought lots of foreigners in, Celtic and others later followed suit and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Scottish national team suffered as a result<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’m not the only one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who thinks that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->England are the new Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The recent Scottish revival has surely been due to Rangers and Celtic developing a core group of home-grown players to complement their foreign signings. And I’m sure that a lot of their England based players can’t wait to get a game for Scotland after watching too many games from the stand or playing for less successful clubs!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overpaid English players<!-- raw HTML omitted -->At club level, Arsenal are successful in part at least because they have a salary structure which prevents them buying overpaid English players, but keeps team spirit up - see how much better they are doing without the overpaid Henry! Same with United to a different extent. Fergie’s discipline is what he buys by paying top wages and Ince, Kanchelskis, Beckham, Van Nistelrooy and Keane are all examples of players who reached their sell-by dates, for the team’s eventual benefit. Chelsea pay everyone top wages, of course, while my guess is that the likes of Liverpool, Newcastle, Spurs and any other under-achievers get the balance wrong between wages and value.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too much pressure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there’s more to it than that. Michael Owen says that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the players can’t cope with the pressure of playing for England now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not that they don’t care. Although at some point we have to admit that other teams are sometimes better than us, that would certainly explain some lacklustre performances and results. Where does the pressure come from? The fans? The media?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My opinion is that the fans want England to win, or - if they can’t win - to play well, trying. The media just want to sell stories, and their marketing strategy is the time-honoured sensationalism of even the most mundane non-news (Steve McClaren under an umbrella. OK, so he looked a bit daft, but, if he kept dry and we’d won…). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we lost to Croatia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What we should all have been saying was congratulations to Croatia on a deserved victory and let’s support McClaren in  rebuilding for real this time instead of picking on every little thing and waiting for him to fail. Things looked good against Russia and Israel, he stumbled across a “system” (Gerrard and Barry) that worked. He was unlucky with injuries, but should have been given longer.</p>\n",

And the media does its best to blame anyone and everyone. <br /><br />There’s such a lot at stake, now. It was only sixty years or so ago that the Football Association, which is now grieving over the financial loss of failure to qualify for Euro 2008 and stating that qualification for Euro and World Cup Finals is a minimum requirement of the team manager/coach, actively prevented the national team from taking part. It’s only forty years or so since we won it. As it happens, Sir Alf Ramsey, like Second Choice Steve McClaren also failed to qualify for his first Euro Finals in 1964…. We have a long history and fine tradition of coming up short against the rest of the world, so it’s not as if it’s anything new or that we should be surprised about.<br /><br />The problem with English football has been documented in the press as being anything from too many foreign players, too much money, expectation of fans not matched with reality, players and coaches not good enough, not enough passion or care, too much passion and not enough technique, too much pressure and fear, too much drinking and not enough team spirit. The reality is probably that all of these factors are important to a lesser or greater degree. <br /><h4 id=\"too-many-foreign-players\">Too many foreign players</h4><a href=\"http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2216346,00.html\" title=\"I can get English players but they cost too much.\">As Sven-Goran Erikkson points out</a>, managers often buy overseas players because they are cheaper on average than their English or British counterparts. That’s also why so few of our players play abroad - because there isn’t the money to pay them, not necessarily that they aren’t good enough. Beckham was and arguably still is good enough to play for Real Madrid. That’s why there are too many foreign players.<br /><h4><b>Too much money</b></h4>So part of the problem may be that the players get paid too much? But that is not the players’ fault, just market forces, mainly to do with Sky TV money and, er, the FA, who contract with them for Premier League (the same FA which hijacked the Football League) and England rights. What this means is that the very best English players - who are on a par at least, with the very best players in the world - are paid significantly more. This is why Arsene Wenger has so few English players in his squad, not because they aren’t good enough, but because they are too expensive. <br /><h4>The new Scotland</h4>Maybe I’m wrong, but it seems to me that we are repeating what happened in Scotland during the Graeme Souness era at Rangers - he bought lots of foreigners in, Celtic and others later followed suit and <a href=\"https://almaxp.wordpress.com/2010/11/14/the-absolute-game-remembered-part-53/\" title=\"Graeme’s insistence on signing non-Scots has ultimately had a deleterious effect on the Scottish national team.\">the Scottish national team suffered as a result</a>. <a href=\"http://onejimmycarter.blogspot.com/2006/04/a-new-scotland-why-englands-football.html\" title=\"A new Scotland\">I’m not the only one</a> who thinks that <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/my-schadenfreude-runs-dry-for-england-the-new-scotland-1.830913\" title=\"England are the new Scotland\">England are the new Scotland</a>.<br /><br />The recent Scottish revival has surely been due to Rangers and Celtic developing a core group of home-grown players to complement their foreign signings. And I’m sure that a lot of their England based players can’t wait to get a game for Scotland after watching too many games from the stand or playing for less successful clubs!<br /><h4 id=\"overpaid-english-players\">Overpaid English players</h4>At club level, Arsenal are successful in part at least because they have a salary structure which prevents them buying overpaid English players, but keeps team spirit up - see how much better they are doing without the overpaid Henry! Same with United to a different extent. Fergie’s discipline is what he buys by paying top wages and Ince, Kanchelskis, Beckham, Van Nistelrooy and Keane are all examples of players who reached their sell-by dates, for the team’s eventual benefit. Chelsea pay everyone top wages, of course, while my guess is that the likes of Liverpool, Newcastle, Spurs and any other under-achievers get the balance wrong between wages and value.<br /><h4>Too much pressure</h4>But there’s more to it than that. Michael Owen says that <a href=\"http://www.jarrowandhebburngazette.com/sport/we-can-t-cope-with-pressure-owen-1-1283821\" title=\"We can't cope with pressure - Owen\">the players can’t cope with the pressure of playing for England now</a>, not that they don’t care. Although at some point we have to admit that other teams are sometimes better than us, that would certainly explain some lacklustre performances and results. Where does the pressure come from? The fans? The media?<br /><br />My opinion is that the fans want England to win, or - if they can’t win - to play well, trying. The media just want to sell stories, and their marketing strategy is the time-honoured sensationalism of even the most mundane non-news (Steve McClaren under an umbrella. OK, so he looked a bit daft, but, if he kept dry and we’d won…). <br /><br />So, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7103110.stm\" title=\"England 2-3 Croatia\">we lost to Croatia</a>. What we should all have been saying was congratulations to Croatia on a deserved victory and let’s support McClaren in  rebuilding for real this time instead of picking on every little thing and waiting for him to fail. Things looked good against Russia and Israel, he stumbled across a “system” (Gerrard and Barry) that worked. He was unlucky with injuries, but should have been given longer.\n",
